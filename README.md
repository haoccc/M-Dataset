## Labeling Strategy

- The content of the review has absolutely nothing to do with the movie being reviewed;

- If the evaluation and rating do not match, the content of the review is rated as a high score for criticism, and the content of the review as a low score for praise;

- The review description is exaggerated and overly praised, full of empty adjectives and pure warm praise, without any shortcomings;

- The content of the reviews is unified, and there are a lot of similar reviews in other movie reviews;

- The review that show too high or too low ratings simply because they like or hate a certain movie star or character 

We consider spam reviews as long as they meet one or more of the above criteria.
