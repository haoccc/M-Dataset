 于是Jewell一夜之间成为了英雄。 但这并不是一个关于一夜成名之后守不住内心的故事。Jewell面对荣誉依然谦逊，认为自己只是碰巧在恰当的时候出现在恰当的地方，然后做了职责该做的事情。
 故事的走向是，FBI认为Jewell符合为了出名而自导自演的炸弹客的特征，所以把他列为头号嫌疑犯进行调查。吃瓜群众喜闻乐见的大反转被媒体知道了，于是大肆报道，Jewell又一夜之间成为了千夫所指。Jewell要持续面对执法机构的调查，住所也被媒体24小时包围，且祸及家人朋友，面临崩溃。
 说实话影片的前半小时挺闷的，但是熬过去之后就渐入佳境了。东木老爷子水平在那，把影片里的“正面人物”包括Jewell、Jewell他妈、Jewell的律师及律师的助理兼对象，都塑造得骨肉丰满。
 相对的，“坏人”就都挺平面和脸谱化的。
 其中一方“坏蛋”，就是以FBI探员Tom Shaw为代表的执法人员。他坚信Jewell就是凶手，领导对Jewell的调查，而且采用了一些不光彩的手段试图对Jewell进行诱供。但是如果换个角度想想的话，Jewell确实符合嫌疑犯的特征，Shaw在法律框架内对其进行最大限度的调查是不是也是职责所在呢。
 碰巧的是，刚看完电影，就看到了金宏伟律师的文章《刑案通识 I 怀疑是证明力最强的证据》，如果金律师看了这部电影，可以把它作为论据写进文章了。 另一个坏角色，是最先写出反转文的《亚特兰大宪章报》女记者Kathy Scruggs。影片对这个角色的塑造完全失败。而且影片加入了她用与Shaw探员上床换取爆料的桥段引起很大争议。
 同样，换个角度，反转文的标题大概是“炸弹‘英雄’被FBI作为头号嫌疑犯调查”之类的。不知道内文是怎么写的，如果只是按照标题这样的报道，虽然引发后续其它媒体针对Jewell的持续骚扰，但Scruggs是否有权发表这篇文章呢？她对Jewell受到的伤害，需要承担多少责任呢？Scruggs确实是在报道一件事实（Jewell被FBI调查），虽然这件事实是基于某些人一些后来被证实是错误的推论（Jewell是炸弹客）。现在写那些“33年前的凯歌”的瘤量自媒体自然不会考虑这个问题，但是如果我们还是秉承严肃的新闻伦理来考量的话，这个问题的答案应该是什么呢？
 经过88天的折磨之后，FBI正式终止对Jewell的调查。
 在现实世界里，Jewell马上与各个媒体对簿公堂，随后大部分的媒体都和Jewell和解赔偿了。但是始作俑的《亚特兰大宪章报》则坚持自己发表的就是一篇基于事实的报道，拒绝和解。 影片的原名是《Richard Jewell》，台湾译名是四平八稳的《李察朱威尔事件》，香港则语不惊人死不休地译成《李察朱维尔：惊世疑案》，而大陆/内地的译名《理查德·朱维尔的哀歌》则是明显加戏了。虽然那88天对Jewell来说肯定是非常不好受，但是执法机关只是礼貌地骗他去录口供，一旦被他发现不对头也只好放他回家，后来为了搜集证据把他家几乎搬空，甚至连他妈妈的内裤都被作为证据收走，被摘走25根头发，备受屈辱，但是起码他人身是自由的，可以和家人朋友律师呆在一起。最后FBI找不到证据，也只能终止对他的调查。他也如愿当上一名片警，甚至8年之后真凶落网，他彻底洗脱嫌疑。
 我们可以设想一下，如果Jewell有幸活在另外一个法治国家，事情会怎么进展。首先，他会被会被拘留48小时，期间不能联系任何人。然后会被批捕，进入看守所，期间不能主动联系任何人，只能偶尔见一下律师，而且这种案子可能会作为恐袭或国家安全相关来定性，那么律师也见不到。在孤立无援的情形下，Jewell估计最后会给执法机关交待出一个完美的犯罪流程。然后他会被移交检察院，再等几个月，被起诉，然后慢慢等，终于等来了开庭，这时候才有可能能远远见到自己的亲人，一句话都不能交谈，开完庭慢慢等等来判决书，移送到监狱，死刑执行。几年之后，真凶落网，沉冤得雪。

个人观影随笔，欢迎理性讨论，不喜勿喷
        东木老爷子都快90岁了，还能拍出这样的电影，实在是令人敬佩，说来很奇怪，每次看老爷子的电影，不管是他主演还是他导演都特别稳，他拍的东西充满了一种沧桑感，对这个世界的理解和认知总是多了一层长辈的语境。 
       之前他拍的《萨利机长》，《换子疑云》，《骡子》都是根据真人真事改编的，似乎老爷子对现实世界有很多话想说，不管愤怒，还是感动，这些电影都代表了一种态度，或左或右，我看短评里有些人说女权人士不喜欢，说老爷子是保守派等等，好吧，这些声音当然可以有，我却有不同的看法，不过保留吧，每个人都有自己都意见，只是电影怎么拍，他只是针对角色，就像昆汀拍《好莱坞往事》，有时候界限和创作是矛盾的，大家变得严肃谨慎，在这种只有一个声音的地方，我已经受够了冠冕堂皇和条条框框，希望能有个平衡吧，不敢说了。 
       说说电影吧，朱维尔的演员演出了很多角色内在的东西，把一个普普通通有缺点的人刻画的惟妙惟肖，当角色不听律师的话喃喃自语时，甚至真的有种想让他闭嘴的冲动，当然越是这样想，越是因为演得传神，还有律师山姆，他的很多角色都没什么区别，从最早看他的《月球》，《火柴人》到《三块广告牌》，好像都是一种人，不过很喜欢这种表演风格，有点痞痞的，目中无人的样子，很有个人魅力的演员。 
       看完电影后，我一直在想，如果我是理查德朱维尔，该如何为自己辩护？好人尽责值守，挽救生命却成了被告人，这种让好人蒙冤的情节，咱这也有，不过不能说，我可能会哭，会委屈，会咆哮，可我却不知道怎么表达，理查德朱维尔在最后对着联邦调查员说的话，其实比任何辩护都有力量，东木老爷子也在讽刺这些人，不过FBI和记者这两个角色，个人感觉不够立体，太脸谱化了，或许出了这种恐怖袭击事件，不管什么制度，都会有不负责任的各种坏人，这只跟人性有关！",3.0,,0

东木在早年凭借犯罪片与西部片在好莱坞扬名，可老爷子在晚年却转换自己的风格，连续的拍摄了多部传记电影：“萨利机长”、“胡佛传”、“成事在人”、“骡子“、以及”美国狙击手”，每一个优秀的导演，在其作品集中都可以找出一些相似的表达，东木与他的“哀歌”也同样不例外。在东木传记电影中的绝大部分人物，都具有同一个特点，那就是：业务能力强。无论是军人，还是司机、保安，他们都在兢兢业业的做着自己的工作，希望能够为社会为国家奉献出自己可靠的一份劳动力，可是尽管是这样，这些原型人物也从来无法拥有善意的结局。所有的“不善”，看似来源于“家庭”“体制”“社会”，可我们如果追根溯源，所有这些的致命因子皆是起源于他们的“循规守纪”、“任劳任怨”、“敬职敬业”、“自立根生”，这不就是美国人和美国政府所一直宣扬的所谓“美国精神”吗？可为何这些地地道道靠自己本事谋生的人物会落得如此下场呢？我并不想也无法将所有这些个人物一概而论，但对于东木镜头下“朱维尔”其人来说，是舆论、是资本、是真相、是民粹、是荣誉、是地位、是公权力。
为何做一个堂堂正正的红脖美国人会在美国命丧黄泉呢？为何一个爱国者会被盖上“恐怖主义”的高帽呢？为何一个对于权力机关信奉尊重的人会反而被其所谋害栽赃呢？这些既电影提出的问题，也是东木站在右翼阵营中一记记响亮的全垒打。为什么？这个问题我沉思良久，最终决定以一句话来回答：因为朱维尔是那个“少数”。
在911事件之后，美国当局大量调拨国家资源打击恐怖犯罪活动，同时设立更多的法条和规定保护国土与国民安全，可时过境迁，当这些所谓的恐怖组织死的死、倒的倒，其借用打击恐怖主义对于他国政府的干涉已演变为政治藉口与战争公义，美国媒体也大规模的报道、刊登美国军队在他国的行迹。在这样一个“恐怖”分子不再“恐怖”的舆论氛围之下，国民对于“恐怖主义”之定义也更发麻木，但资本却对于其更加的敏感，当媒体意识到，他们可以靠“恐怖“以博取眼球之时，行业内部的竞争将会直接导致新闻对于“热点”的渴求逐渐超过“真相”。虽然，911事件发生在爆炸案的五年之后，可美国人对于“爆炸新闻”的诉求，已经远远高过了爆炸。当资本来的如此廉价，当行业内的晋升途径随着社会制度以及资本流转系统的健全而越发明了之时，那些追求以汗水换取成果的人，他们的生活甚至生命将会受到挤压。东木所要讽刺的其实并不是这一套规则本身，而是站在规则之后任其发展的每一个个体，以及由其构成的美利坚合众国。在这个规则有条有理的过度，自由已成为笑柄、公权已成为摆设。
这就是我提到的“少数”，爱这个国家的人越来越少，于是这些对国家、对权力机关仍然抱持着愚忠的人，将会被满眼都是“名利”的人所排挤、所剥削，能力强大的人会悄悄蚕食弱小的，弱小的将会以“朱维尔”这样的“爱国者”为食继续向上攀登。朱维尔的母亲在发布会上哀求总统帮助儿子洗刷冤屈的桥段尤其荒诞，我忍不住联想到“胡佛传”里依靠搜集花边新闻便可以在位48年控制五届总统的FBI局长，这些个至高权力在东木的眼中，不过是资本与权力搭建的“纸牌屋”罢了，他们无法放下自己的高高在上像美国人信仰的天主教一样，和你一同虔诚的祷告。爱国已经无济于事，因为这个你趋之若鹜的国家已经可以为了“眼球”、“热点”、“爆点”去背叛每一个他的臣子，他们不需要爱国者，他们只需要那些可以为他们肝脑涂地的马前卒罢了。正如律师对朱维尔说的：窗外那些你声称信任的人，都是豺狼虎豹，想要把你生吞活剥。
这个时代，也是同样不需要英雄的，当朱维尔名声大噪之后，除了零星的媒体对他进行了采访之外，只有一个想要写假传记的作者前来登门拜访。而当“亚特兰大宪法报”声称朱维尔被列为联邦嫌疑人后，铺天盖地的媒体记者、执法机构将朱维尔的家层层围住。在美国每天都有各种各样接受表彰的英雄，可是恶人却是越发的罕见，流量与热度自然更渴望出现恶人而甚于英雄，英雄的价值也许在“父辈的旗帜”中就已经被榨干了。除了英雄，朱维尔至始至终是那个尽忠职守的人，他在公司里细心的观察别人需要，他在学校里规矩查寝，他在奥运会上按照安保规矩查包，他按规矩配合FBI调查，但所有规矩之外的事情，他都不会做，即使是那些个他所深信不疑的调查员让他签署一份他不认可的文件，但正是这样一个按规矩做事的人，却“死”在了一群不知规矩为何的人手里：诱供的FBI探员、透露消息给情妇的督察、没有职业操守的女记者、为抢头版不惜真相的主编。显然，讲规则的人被不讲规则的人所“规则杀”，以国家为信仰的人信仰破灭，尊重权力的人被权力所迫害，那么规则到底于这些讲规则的人有何用呢？问题又回到原初。规则本身并无问题，出问题的是那些规则的被利用、被裹挟，这是如此，纯粹的人才会被这个不再纯粹的社会所吞噬。
这个国家原本是由用自己的劳动以换取功名的祖辈所创建的，可如今想要靠着邪门歪道来实现阶级跃升的人已然成为了社会的主流文化，所以资本才足够有力量去洗刷“恐怖主义”的罪恶，使之成为社会思潮的载体。这样的一个大载体容不下有情有义的人，律师也可以成为一个很好的例子，他原本在大事务所工作，后来正是因为自己不想被别人指手画脚才打主意单干。当面对朱维尔时，律师第一个问题便是：真的是你干的吗？看似一个闲笔，却道出了律师与朱维尔之间游离于资本雇佣关系之外的契约关系，那就是“情义”，这个在朱维尔所处的世界里难能可贵的字眼。在很多以律师为蓝本所编排的剧集电影作品中，比如“罪恶之奔”、“风骚律师”，我们经常会见到这样一个桥段：嫌疑人告诉律师自己没有犯事，这时律师会老练油滑地回答他这和我无关，我只在意我们怎么赢。所以，能问出这个问题的律师，也自然会毫不犹豫选择为他而战，律师了解朱维尔的过去，他和朱维尔在某些方面其实都是一种人，都是对于美国曾经的价值观坚信不疑的人。
当这个堕落的体制开始攻陷一个人的时候，朱维尔所有符合犯罪心理的特征全都会被合理化，他的守规矩成了“偏执”、成了对于“名利”的渴望，和母亲住在一起的肥胖男子就一定是“同性恋”，“同性恋”就更可能犯罪，他们把朱维尔塑造成了他们自己的样子、塑造成朱维尔最讨厌成为的那一类人。这难道不是一个越来越相似的社会吗？明明要升官发财的是他们，要功成名就的是他们，那些应该为朱维尔之死负责人也正是他们，把所有人变成一种人，才得以同流合污。
都说英雄要屠恶龙才能被称作是英雄，比起“萨利机长”，朱维尔、他的母亲、他的律师，所面对的才是真正的恶龙，只不过萨利杀死了一头假的恶龙，而真正的恶龙，已经把朱维尔吃掉了，看到片尾字幕里“朱维尔”的结局，我知道，恶龙还活着，那个想要屠龙的勇士却已经死了，死的时候不知道是否还哼唱着那一首哀歌。",13.0,,0

Paul和Sam把理查德和律师演活了 理查德是一个很常见的美国小城的善良邻家大胖哥哥的形象。怂怂的“面团宝宝”、正义的使者、规则维护者，都是他，Paul的表演让我对这个人物的冲突性没有任何质疑。美女记者的最好看的一段戏是在发表了爆炸新闻后被全体致敬后的得意和疯癫。不过大多数观众最喜欢的应该会是Sam的痞痞律师吧，表演完全没毛病，如果我会再看一次这个电影的话，八成是因为想重温Sam的戏。  三. 看完觉得一口气憋在胸口 总觉得故事没讲完 没有看嗨。因为直到影片结束，还觉得有什么没有演出来。诚然本片主角是理查德，对于理查德的心理变化和对司法的观点变化的描绘得很详细，但是对司法和媒体这两大影响着“为英雄正名”事件的人物代表选择了基本是纯负面的角度去描绘。 当片子出现了明确的好人和坏人的阵营时，观影的嗨感会下降。  四. 总而言之太脸谱化 对人物的描绘不够丰满，对几个主要角色的处理过于扁平。 反面脸谱化了司法和媒体。让整个片子少了一些真实感。FBI探员和美女记者都使用了典型的坏人光影处理（如FBI探员哄着理查德录爆恐吓语音的典型坏人化光影、美女记者在主编室争取发表爆炸新闻的脸部明暗交叠光影）。 FBI的两个探员一个没有起到啥作用，一个全程在违反规则、跟着感觉走，在大费周章做了调查但没找到任何证据的情况下，依旧认为理查德是凶犯，FBI探员真的只有这个水平吗？（手动摊手表情） 原以为在影片后半部分能帮到理查德的美女记者并没有起到什么作用。只是在现场走了一圈、恍然大悟了一下、跑去酒吧骂了一句FBI探员、在发布会上流了几滴眼泪，然后就没有然后了。  总评： 满分十分的话，我给六分。 加分项：1)对理查德心理变化的描绘 2)演员的表演 3)场景的设置 尤其是对一个坚定拥护司法系统的人的信仰逐步破灭的全过程描绘得很流畅。 减分项：1)脸谱化司法和媒体代表 2)故事展现角度片面（比如：难道声名显赫的FBI真的只会揪着一个没有任何作案证据的人去调查，没有同步调查任何其他人？）,26.0,5.0,3

For the first time, the 34-year-old security guard tells his extraordinary story, to MARIE BRENNER: his brief moment as a national hero, his hounding by the Feds and the press, and his eccentric friendship with the unknown southern lawyer who helped him through his public torment.
 FEBRUARY 1997 MARIE BRENNER
DAN WINTERS
The search warrant was short and succinct, dated August 3, 9:41 A.M. F.B.I. special agent Diader Rosario was instructed to produce ""hair samples (twenty-five pulled and twenty-five combed hairs from the head)"" of Richard Allensworth Jewell. That Saturday, Atlanta was humid; the temperature would rise to 85 degrees. There were 34 Olympic events scheduled, including women's team handball, but Richard Jewell was in his mother's apartment playing Defender on a computer set up in the spare bedroom. Jewell hadn't slept at all the night before, or the night before that. He could hear the noise from the throng of reporters massed on the hill outside the small apartment in the suburbs. All morning long, he had been focused on the screen, trying to score off ""the little guy who goes back and forth shooting the aliens,"" but at 12:30 the sound of the telephone disturbed his concentration. Very few people had his new number, by necessity unlisted. Since the F.B.I. had singled him out as the Olympic Park bombing suspect three days earlier, Jewell had received approximately 1,000 calls a day—someone had posted his mother's home number on the Internet.

""I'll be right over,"" his lawyer Watson Bryant told him. ""They want your hair, they want your palm prints, and they want something called a voice exemplar—the goddamn bastards."" The curtains were drawn in the pastel apartment filled with his mother's crafts and samplers; A HOME WITHOUT A DOG IS JUST A HOUSE, one read. By this time Bryant had a system. He would call Jewell from his car phone so that the door could be unlatched and Bryant could avoid the questions from the phalanx of reporters on the hill.

Turning into the parking lot in a white Explorer, Bryant could see sound trucks parked up and down Buford Highway. The middle-class neighborhood of apartment complexes and shopping centers was near the DeKalb Peachtree Airport, where local millionaires kept their private planes. The moment Bryant got out of his car, the reporters began to shout: ""Hey, Watson, do they have the murderer?"" ""Are they arresting Jewell?"" Bryant moved quickly toward the staircase to the Jewells' apartment. He wore a baseball cap, khaki shorts, and a frayed Brooks Brothers polo shirt. He was 45 years old, with strong features and thinning hair, a southern preppy from a country-club family. Bryant had a stern demeanor lightened by a contrarian's sense of the absurd. He was often distracted—from time to time he would miss his exits on the highway—and he had the regional tendency of defining himself by explaining what he was not. ""I am not a Democrat, because they want your money. I am not a Republican, because they take your rights away,"" he told me soon after I met him. Bryant can talk your ear off about the Bill of Rights, ending with a flourish: ""I think everyone ought to have the right to be stupid. I am a Libertarian.""

At the time Richard Jewell was named as a suspect by the F.B.I., Watson Bryant made a modest living by doing real-estate closings in the suburbs, but Jewell and his lawyer had formed an unusual friendship a decade earlier, when Jewell worked as a mailroom clerk at a federal disaster-relief agency where Bryant practiced law. Jewell was then a stocky kid without a father, who had trained as an auto mechanic but dreamed of being a policeman; Bryant had always had a soft spot for oddballs and strays, a personality quirk which annoyed his then wife no end.

The serendipity of this friendship, an alliance particularly southern in its eccentricity, would bring Watson Bryant to the immense task  of attempting to save Richard Jewell from the murky quagmire of a national terrorism case. The simple fact was that Bryant had no qualifications for the job. He had no legal staff except for his assistant, Nadya Light, no contacts in the press, and no history in Washington. He was the opposite of media-savvy; he rarely read the papers and never watched the nightly news, preferring the Discovery Channel's shows on dog psychology. Now that Richard Jewell was his client, he had entered a zone of worldwide media hysteria fraught with potential peril. Jewell suspected that his pickup truck had been flown in a C-130 transport plane to the F.B.I. unit at Quantico in Virginia, and Bryant worried that his friend would be arrested any minute. Worse, Bryant knew that he had nothing going for him, no levers anywhere. His only asset was his personality; he had the bravado and profane hyperbole of a southern rich boy, but he was in way over his head.

For hours that Saturday, Bryant and Jewell sat and waited for the F.B.I. From time to time Jewell would put binoculars under the drawn curtain in his mother's bedroom to peer at the reporters on the hill. Bryant was nervous that Jewell's mother, Bobi, would return from baby-sitting and see her son having hairs pulled out of his head. Bryant stalked around the apartment complaining about the F.B.I. ""The sons of bitches did not show up until three P.M.,"" he later recalled, and when they did, there were five of them. The F.B.I. medic was tall and muscular and wore rubber gloves. He asked Jewell to sit at a small round table in the living room, where his mother puts her holiday-theme displays. Bryant stood by the sofa next to a portrait of Jewell in his Habersham County deputy's uniform. He watched the F.B.I. procedure carefully. The medic, who had huge hands, used tiny drugstore tweezers. ""He eyeballed his scalp and took his hair in sections. First he ran a comb through it, and then he took these hairs and plucked them out one by one.""

Jewell ""went stone-cold,"" but Bryant could not contain his temper. ""I am his lawyer. I know you can have this, I know you have a search warrant, but I tell you this: If you were doing this to me, you would have to fight me. You would have to beat the shit out of me,"" Bryant recalled telling the case agent Ed Bazar. Bazar, Bryant later said, was apologetic. ""He seemed almost embarrassed to be there."" As he counted out the hairs, he placed them in an envelope. The irony of the situation was not lost on Bryant. He was a lawyer, an officer of the court, but he had a disdain for authority, and he was representing a former deputy who read the Georgia law code for fun in his spare time.

It took 10 minutes to pluck Jewell's thick auburn hair. Then the F.B.I. agents led him into the kitchen and took his palm prints on the table. ""That took 30 minutes, and they got ink all over the table,"" Bryant said. Then Bazar told Bryant they wanted Jewell to sit on the sofa and say into the telephone, ""There is a bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes."" That was the message given by the 911 caller on the night of the bombing. He was to repeat the message 12 times. Bryant saw the possibility of phony evidence and of his client's going to jail. ""I said, 'I am not sure about this. Maybe you can do this, maybe you can't, but you are not doing this today.'""

All afternoon, Jewell was strangely quiet. He had a sophisticated knowledge of police work and believed, he later said, ""they must have had some evidence if they wanted my hair. ... I knew their game was intimidation. That is why they brought five agents instead of two."" He felt ""violated and humiliated,"" he told me, but he was passive, even docile, through Bryant's outburst. He thought of the bombing victims— Alice Hawthorne, the 44-year-old mother from Albany, Georgia, at the park with her stepdaughter; Melih Uzunyol, the Turkish cameraman who died of a heart attack; the more than 100 people taken to area hospitals, some of whom were his friends. ""I kept thinking, These guys think I did this. These guys were accusing me of murder. This was the biggest case in the nation and the world. If they could pin it on me, they were going to put me in the electric chair.""

I met Richard Jewell three months later, on October 28, a few hours before a press conference called by his lawyers to allow Jewell to speak publicly for the first time since the F.B.I. had cleared him. Jewell's lawyers also intended to announce that they would file damage suits against NBC and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It was a Monday, and that weekend the local U.S. attorney had delivered a letter to one of the lawyers stating Jewell was no longer a suspect. ""Goddamn it,"" Bryant had told me on the phone, ""the sons of bitches did not even have the decency to address it to Richard Jewell.""

I had been instructed to come early to the offices of Wood &amp; Grant, the flashy plaintiff lawyers Bryant had pulled in to help him with Jewell's civil suits.  When I arrived, I was alone in the office with Sharon Anderson, the redheaded assistant answering the phones. ""Wood &amp; Grant . . . Wood &amp; Grant . . . Wood &amp; Grant""—the calls overwhelmed her. Lin Wood and Wayne Grant were rushing from CNN to the local NBC and ABC affiliates, working the shows. ""Everyone has theories of who the real bomber is,"" Sharon said. ""I just write it all down and give it to the boys.""

When Lin Wood arrived, he was still in full makeup. Movie-star handsome with green eyes and styled hair, Wood has the heated oratory of a trial lawyer. ""It's a war! Why in this bevy of stories does not anyone point out the fact that Richard was a hero one day and a demon the next? They have destroyed this man's life!""

Watson Bryant had worked with Wood and Grant years before in a local law firm. He admired Wayne Grant for his methodical sense of detail; Grant, a New Yorker, had once forced the city of Atlanta to pay large damages to a man injured while illegally digging for antique bottles in a park. But Lin Wood's suppressed rage was a marvel to Bryant. ""He is so tough he could make people cry in depositions when we were kids,"" Bryant told me. Wood possessed the smooth style of a member of the Atlanta establishment, but he had a hardscrabble past. He was a boy from ""the wrong side of the tracks"" in Macon who at age 17 discovered his mother's body after his father had murdered her. His father went to jail, and Wood wound up as a lawyer. He went through college and law school on scholarships and with part-time jobs. I could hear Wood on Sharon's telephone: ""He's more than innocent. He's a goddamn hero. . . . Everyone is going to pay who wronged Richard Jewell. Besides NBC and The A.J.C., we are going to look into suing CNN and Jay Leno.""

Through the large picture window, I had a clear view of the remains of the Centennial Olympic Park, where the bomb had exploded on the night of July 26. Where the sound-and-light tower had once been, there was now a flattened dirt field. It was possible to see the Greek commemorative sculpture that Richard Jewell used to describe for tourists at the AT&amp;T pavilion, where he worked as a security guard.

Suddenly, Jewell was in the room. ""Hi. I'm Richard. I'm a little late. I don't want you to think I am rude. I am not like that."" He had an open face, a bland pleasantness, an eagerness to please. ""Can I get you a Coke?"" he asked me. ""How about some coffee?"" Jewell wore a blue-and-white striped shirt and chinos. He occupied physical space like a teenager; he sprawled, he lumbered, he pawed through Sharon's candy bowl. On TV his face had a porcine blankness; he appeared suspicious. In person, Jewell has a hard time disguising his emotions.

We were alone in the conference room; I noticed that Jewell avoided looking out the window toward the park. He shifted his glance nervously away from the view. He often awakens in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, thinking of the events in the park in the early morning hours of July 27. ""It took me days before I could even come in here,"" he said anxiously.

The newsroom atmosphere resembled that at F.B.I. headquarters; there was a frenzy to be first.
When Jewell noticed a local ABC reporter outside near Sharon's desk, his face darkened. ""I don't want to be around reporters right now. I guess I am a little nervous. What is he doing here?"" The atmosphere was now filled with tension; the reporter was escorted out.

Moments later, we gathered in the hallway. Wood was steely: ""We are going in two cars. Richard, you drive with me. Your mother will go with Wayne. As we walk down the hall right now, if the ABC people are outside, I will tap you on the shoulder and I will say, 'How are you doing?' You will say, 'Fine.' Is that understood?"" ""O.K., Lin. I understand,"" Jewell said quietly, head bowed.

As Jewell walked down the hall, an ABC cameraman photographed him looking grim. Seconds after the elevator doors closed, Jewell exploded: ""What are they doing here, Lin? Did you invite them? They are animals. Why didn't you get them out of here?""

""ABC has been good to you. How do I get them out of the office on the day of your press conference?""

""That is what security is for!"" Jewell said, quivering with rage. ""Where is Watson?"" he asked in the garage. ""I told you: he's at a real-estate closing. He will meet you at the press conference,"" Wood said. Jewell moved to his mother's side, as solicitous as a child. ""Are you all right, Mother?"" he asked. ""It is all I am going to be able to do not to do something!"" she said angrily.

When we arrived at the Marriott hotel on 1-75, there was another discussion in the parking lot, about who would walk with whom in front of the cameras. Jewell turned to his close friend Dave Dutchess: ""Are you all right, man?"" Dutchess, a truckdriver who worked with Jewell years ago, has long hair and a tattoo of a panther on his forearm. ""Richard and I are like brothers,"" he told me. ""I would die for him."" As the cameras closed in on them, the group fled to a private room in the Marriott. The auditorium was filled with reporters. ""Showtime! Showtime!"" the cameramen yelled when Jewell, his mother, and all the lawyers took the stage.

""I hope and pray that no one else is ever subjected to the pain and the ordeal that I have gone through,"" Jewell said, his voice breaking. ""The authorities should keep in mind the rights of the citizens. I thank God it is ended and that you now know what I have known all along: I am an innocent man.""

After the press conference, Bobi and Richard Jewell remained in a private room. The bookers from Good Morning America and the Today show pressed Jewell to step before their cameras, and when Watson Bryant told them no, Monica, the G.M.A. booker, began to cry, ""I'll lose my job."" Then Yael, the Today-show booker, cornered Nadya Light: ""Is Richard doing something with G.M.A.?'

Upstairs, Jewell and his mother were being filmed by a CBS camera crew for a 60 Minutes news update. ""Well, Bobi, did you get your Tupperware back?"" Mike Wallace asked by phone from New York. ""Richard, you need to lose some more weight."" Despite Wallace's festive spirit, the atmosphere was curiously flat. Bryant urged Jewell to talk to a USA Today reporter. Jewell balked: ""They can all go suck wind.""

In the car on the way back to Wood &amp; Grant, Bobi was angry. All of her possessions had come back from the F.B.I. marked up with ink. ""Every piece of Tupperware I own is ruined, thank you very much. They wrote numbers all over it, and I have tried everything to clean it—Comet and Brillo—but nothing works.""

Back at the office, she sat on the sofa and listened as Bryant negotiated with Yael for a flight to New York— Delta, first-class, 9:30 P.M. Jewell was scheduled to appear on three shows in New York, visit the American Museum of Natural History, and then fly to Washington, D.C., for Larry King Live. ""I would like to go home, put on my outfit, and walk in the woods,"" Bobi said. ""Richard, we are leaving.""

""Yes, ma'am,"" Richard said.

One hour later, a telephone call came in to the offices of Wood &amp; Grant. The lawyers had the call on speaker, and it blared through the room. ""Goddamn it, Lin. When will this be over?"" In the background, you could hear Bobi sobbing. ""What in the world?"" Wood asked. Jewell explained that a sound truck from ABC had been waiting in the parking lot when the Jewells got home. There had been words and threats, and Dave Dutchess had taken his stun gun off his motorcycle and waved it at the ABC van. The cameraman yelled: Stop harassing us! Dave yelled back: You are harassing us! Now get your ass out of here!

Wood shouted into the speakerphone: ""Do not meddle! You cannot jeopardize where you have gotten to and what you want to do! All you have to do is put up with this for one more day and the damn thing is over. Bobi, there is nothing you can do about it; you have to stay cool."" Bobi cried back, ""They are going to destroy me!""

The moment they hung up, Wood turned to Bryant. ""New York is canceled. No Katie Couric. No Good Morning America. They are losing it. You better call Yael."" ""No,"" Bryant said, ""they have lost it. All of the above: their patience, their temper and heart.""

That evening a very testy Katie Couric tracked Bryant down at Nadya Light's apartment, where we had gone to watch the news. ""I want you to know that I canceled interviewing Barbra Streisand in L.A. for Richard Jewell. Don't think he is always going to be a news story. No one will care about him in three days,"" she said, according to Bryant. ""Look, Katie, I am sorry. But Richard is in no condition to talk to the press. He is worn out,"" Bryant told her.

Later, Jewell would tell me that that day, which should have been one of his most satisfying, was actually his worst. His notoriety had tainted the triumph; everything positive had become negative. ""I was in despair,"" he said. As he had for most of the previous 88 days, he spent the night confined in the Buford Highway apartment, a prisoner of his circumstances, with his mother, Dave Dutchess, and Dave's fiancee, Beatty, eating Domino's Pizza and watching himself lead the newscasts on NBC, CBS, and ABC.

""This case has everything—the F.B.I., the press, the violation of the Bill of Rights from the First to the Sixth Amendment."" 
'This case has everything— the F.B.I., the press, the violation of the Bill of Rights, from the First to the Sixth Amendment,"" Watson Bryant told me in one of our first conversations. It has become common to characterize the F.B.I.'s investigation of Richard Jewell as the epitome of false accusation. The phrase ""the Jewell syndrome,"" a rush to judgment, has entered the language of newsrooms and First Amendment forums. On the night of Jewell's press conference, a commentator on CNN's Crossfire compared Jewell's situation to ""Kafka in Prague."" The case became an investigative catastrophe, which laid bare long-simmering resentments of many F.B.I. career professionals regarding the micromanagement style and imperious attitude of Louis Freeh and his inner circle of former New York prosecutors, who have worked together since their days at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District. Within the bureau, the beleaguered director now has a new nickname: J. Edgar Hoover with children. Like Freeh, those near him have also acquired a nickname: Louie's yes-men. Two of Freeh's closest associates, F.B.I. general counsel Howard Shapiro and former deputy director Larry Potts, have been severely criticized, respectively, for advising the White House of confidential F.B.I. material and for an alleged cover-up of the mishandling of the 1992 standoff at Ruby Ridge, where F.B.I. agents killed the wife and son of Randy Weaver, a white supremacist.

In November and December, the Office of Professional Responsibility conducted an exhaustive investigation into the Jewell affair. Responding to an attempt by headquarters and certain officials to distance themselves, according to F.B.I. sources, several agents, including a senior F.B.I. supervisor in Atlanta, have provided the O.P.R. with signed statements insisting that Freeh himself was responsible for ""oversight"" during the crisis. These agents ""shocked the investigators"" because they reiterated, when asked who was in charge of the overall command of the investigation, that it was the director himself.

What happened to Richard Jewell raises an important question central to Freeh's future tenure: in the midst of a media frenzy, does the F.B.I. have any responsibility to protect the privacy of an innocent man? Over the last year, this concept was broached with Bob Bucknam, Louis Freeh's chief of staff. During the long Pizza Connection trial in the 1980s, it was Bucknam who handed Freeh files at the prosecutor's table. According to highly placed sources in the bureau, Bucknam's answer was immediate: the F.B.I. has no responsibility to correct information in the public domain.

Richard Jewell had a reverence for authority that blinded him to the paradox of his situation. He idealized the investigative skills of the F.B.I. and could not understand that he had become ensnared in a web fraught with the weaknesses of a self-protective bureaucracy. Pennsylvania senator Arlen Specter has invited Jewell to Washington to testify at congressional hearings on the F.B.I.'s conduct in the Atlanta bombing. Ironically, the bungling of the investigation might lead to the reshuffling of personalities at the top of the bureau and threaten Freeh's reputation. In October, according to The Washington Post, Freeh sent an unusual memo to all 25,000 F.B.I. personnel: He would not be abandoning his post amid reports of problems with the Jewell case and Filegate, and of a growing dissatisfaction inside the bureau. ""I am proud to be the F.B.I. director,"" Freeh wrote.

From the beginning, Jewell was perceived in the public imagination as a hapless dummy, a plodding misfit, a Forrest Gump. On one of the first days he worked as a security guard at the AT&amp;T pavilion, he noticed that his co-workers were covering the steps inside the sound tower with graffiti. On one step Jewell scrawled with a flourish two bromides: IF YOU DIDN'T GO PAST ME, YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE and LIFE IS TOUGH. TOUGHER WHEN YOU ARE STUPID. Soon after he was targeted as a suspect in the Olympics bombing, the F.B.I. confiscated the step. Analysts appeared to believe that the graffiti contained a clue to his character. ""They told the lawyers the statement was an obvious taunt,"" Jewell said. In fact, the second line was an expression he had cribbed from one of his favorite actors, John Wayne.

Within the F.B.I., the beleaguered director has a new nickname: J. Edgar Hoover with children.
""To understand Richard Jewell, you have to be aware that he is a cop. He talks like a cop and thinks like a cop,"" his criminal lawyer, Jack Martin, told me. The tone of Jewell's voice drops noticeably when he says the word ""officer,"" and his conversation is filled with observations about traffic patterns, security devices, and car wrecks. Even the vocabulary he uses to describe the 88 days he was a suspect is out of the lexicon of police work, and he continues to talk about his situation then in the present tense: ""This is an out-and-out ambush, and I am a hostage.""

Jewell has a need to accommodate. He can be startlingly opaque. On the afternoon of July 30, Jewell answered the door of his mother's apartment to Don Johnson and Diader Rosario from the F.B.I. ""We need your help making a training film,"" they told him. ""I never questioned it,"" he told me. The next day Rosario appeared again with a search warrant. ""The weird thing was that when they were searching my apartment I was, like, 'Take everything. Take the carpet. I am law enforcement. I am just like you. Guys, take whatever you are going to take, because it is going to prove that I didn't do anything.' And a couple of them were looking at me like I was crazy.""

Leaving the apartment on one occasion, he told the agents, ""I am wearing a bright shirt so y'all can see me easier."" He recalled feeling anger when he read descriptions of himself as a child-man, a mama's boy, and ""a wannabe policeman,"" but he said, ""If I was in the place of everybody else and I saw a 34-year-old guy living with his mother, I would have reservations about that, too. I would think, Why is he doing that?""

The December issue of  Atlanta magazine reported that there was no  record of a Jewell family in Danville, Virginia,  where Richard Jewell  was born. Atlanta referred to an article in the Danville Register &amp; Bee which asked, ""Did Richard Jewell ever sleep here?"" ""This is a part of my life Richard and I do not like to speak about,"" Bobi Jewell told me one night at dinner. Richard was born in Danville, but his name was Richard White; his father was Bobi's first husband, Robert Earl White, who worked for Chevrolet. According to Bobi, Richard's father, who died recently, was ""irresponsible and a ladies' man."" When Richard was four, the marriage broke up. Bobi found work as an insurance-agency claims coordinator and soon met John Jewell, an executive in the same business. Shortly after John Jewell married Bobi, he adopted Richard.

From the time Richard was a child, he and his mother were a unit. Bobi, a woman of intelligence and disciplined work habits, is both tender and tough on the subject of her son. She still calls Richard ""my boy,"" but she has a peppery disposition. Richard was brought up in a strict Baptist home. ""If I didn't say 'Yes, ma'am' or 'No, ma'am' and get it out quick enough, I would be on the ground,"" he said. When he was six, the family moved to Atlanta. Richard was the boy who helped the teachers and worked as a school crossing guard, but he had few friends in high school. ""I was a wannabe athlete, but I wasn't good enough,"" he said. He ran the movie projector in the library. A military-history buff, he liked to talk about Napoleon and the Vietnam War and read books on both World Wars.

Jewell's ambition was to work on cars, so he enrolled in a technical school in southern Georgia. On his third day there, Bobi discovered that her husband had packed a suitcase. ""He left a note saying that he was a failure and no good for us,"" Jewell said. Almost immediately, Richard moved back home and took a job repairing cars. ""My mom and I tried to take care of each other,"" he said. ""I think I handled it pretty much better than she did."" Richard took the brunt of his father's abandonment; Bobi pulled even closer to her son. ""She hated all men for about three years after that, and she became overly protective of me. She looked at it that I was going to do the same thing that my dad did. I was 18 or 19. I was working. She never liked my dates, but I never held that against her. We have always been able to lean on each other.""

Richard managed a local TCBY yogurt shop and once stopped a burglary in progress. At the age of 22, he was hired as a clerk at the Small Business Administration, and he impressed Watson Bryant and the other lawyers in the office with his personable nature. They called him Radar because of his efficiency. ""You could say, 'I'm hungry,' and suddenly this kid would be by your side with a Snickers bar,"" Bryant recalled. When Jewell's contract with the S.B.A. ran out, he moved on to be a Marriott house detective. In 1990 he was hired as a jailer in the Habersham County Sheriff's Office, and in 1991 he became a deputy. As part of his training, he was sent to the Northeast Georgia Police Academy, where he finished in the upper 25 percent of his class. He finally had an identity; he was a law-enforcement officer.

Jewell was unlucky in love. He presented one woman with an engagement ring, and later, in Habersham County, he would give another a large wooden key with a sign that read, THIS IS THE KEY TO UNLOCK YOUR HEART, but both relationships came apart. In northern Georgia, Jewell worked nights and became wedded to his job. By his own description, he was methodical. ""I am the kind of person who plans everything. I like to go from A to B to C to D. This going from A to D and arguing over everything—I say no."" Habersham County, a scenic part of the piney woods in Georgia's Bible Belt, was for Jewell like ""leaving the 1990s and going into the 1970s in terms of law enforcement."" Many rich Atlantans have country houses in the mountains, but the small towns of Demorest and Charlottesville are relatively undeveloped, reminding one of Jewell's lawyers of the scenery in the movie Deliverance. ""If you get lost up there, you might find a guy with a bow and arrow,"" the lawyer said.

Recently, Jewell and I took the 90-minute drive from Atlanta to Habersham County, which has acres of apple orchards. The leaves were turning, and the roads were mostly deserted. In the towns, however, were stores, apple stands, and even a good Chinese restaurant. As Jewell's blue pickup truck turned into the parking lot of a shopping center, several people came out to greet him.

Jewell had lived in a small yellow house up a steep rocky driveway. On the day we visited, the current resident's Halloween decorations were still up, as were faded white satin ribbons hanging from many trees, remnants of a campaign to clear Richard Jewell organized by area friends. Jewell had lived 50 yards from the Chattahoochee River near a kayak-and-canoe tourist concession on a main road—not in a ""cabin in the woods,"" as several reports stated after the bombing. He worked the night shift, and when he would arrive home at dawn, he told me, he could look up and ""see a sky filled with stars.""

He was not a loner; he made friends with several local families. He would often leave a box of Dunkin' Donuts on friends' porches at four A.M. During the O. J. Simpson trial, he and the other deputies would meet in the turnaround on Highway 985 in the middle of the night and review the day's events and the bungling by the Los Angeles Police Department. Jewell would later be annoyed that the F.B.I. confiscated his copy of former prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi's account of the trial. Jewell dated a local girl, Sheree Chastain, and had a close relationship with her family.

Jewell had a complex history working at the Habersham County Sheriff's Office. When he was still a jailer, he arrested a couple making too much noise in a hot tub at an apartment building where he did part-time security work. He was arrested for impersonating an officer and, after pleading guilty to a lesser charge, was placed on probation on the condition that he seek psychological counseling.

By his own estimation, Jewell's strength as a cop was ""working car wrecks."" He had his mother's diligence; he worked 14 hours a day and organized a safety fair. Later in 1995 he wrecked his patrol car and was demoted to working in the jail. Rick Moore, a local deputy, advised him to accept the job, but Jewell despised the jailhouse atmosphere. He told me, ""It was a small room filled with cigarette smoke. I couldn't take it."" He resigned, and in a short time he moved to a police job at Piedmont College, a liberal-arts school with approximately 1,000 students on the main road in Demorest. The college police had jurisdiction only on campus and in an area extending out 500 feet. Jewell chased cars speeding down the highway and had arguments over turf with other officers. He was instrumental in several arrests, including that of a suspected burglar he discovered hiding at the top of a tree. For his work on a volunteer rescue squad, he was named a citizen of the year.

According to Brad Mattear, a former resident director, Piedmont was a school of ""P.K.'s""—preachers' kids. It was 80 percent Baptist with a strict no-drinking rule. The college had many rebellious students, according to Mattear, kids who were ""away from home for the first time and wanted to party and drink."" Mattear knew Jewell well and recalled his good manners and playful nature. ""It was always 'Yes, sir' and 'Yes, ma'am.'"" Jewell would tell students, ""I know y'all are going to drink. Don't do it on campus.""

Jewell felt confined by his boundaries and could be heavy-handed when it came to writing out reports on minor infractions. Once when we were driving by the campus, he pointed to a small brick dormitory. ""That was where all the partying would go on,"" he told me. Jewell would raid dorm rooms and report drinking violations. ""I did not hesitate to tell the parents—in no uncertain terms—what their kids were up to,"" he said.

He soon made enemies at the school. ""Three or four times a week,"" Mattear said, Piedmont students were in the office of Ray Cleere, the president of the college, complaining about Jewell and other Piedmont police. After Jewell was admonished for a number of controversial arrests, he resigned.

Jewell had an out: his mother was going  to have an operation on her foot. He would go home to Atlanta for the Olympics and look for a new job. He called his mother: ""Is it all right with you if I stay with you while you have your surgery?"" He hoped he might get a job with the Atlanta police or, failing that, work security at the Olympics. ""I thought, Working at the Centennial Olympic Park will look really good on my resume.""

At the age of 33, back in his mother's apartment, he was at first treated like a wayward teenager. Bobi was sharp with him about his slovenly habits, his weight, and his driving. Bobi had carved out a life for herself; she arrived at work by eight A.M. each morning and had many friends. Trim, with short-cropped hair, Bobi Jewell is the kind of woman who labels her clothes and spices and spends much of her spare time baking cakes and babysitting for extra money. She carries on telephone friendships with claim adjusters at other companies. It was somewhat unsettling for her, she told me, to have Richard at home after she had grown used to living with only her dog, Brandi, and her cat, Boots. Bobi was annoyed that he had wrecked a patrol car, and worried about his safety. ""Every time he leaves the apartment, I'll say, 'Richard . . . ' And he'll say, 'Yes, ma'am. I know. The person that I am going to see will be there when I get there,'"" she said. On one occasion Bobi talked about Richard's return to Atlanta. ""What is wrong with trying to revamp your life?"" she asked me. Her eyes filled with tears. ""Why does everyone in the media think it is so strange?""

On Friday, July 26, Bobi Jewell was home waiting for her niece to arrive from Virginia for the Olympic softball competition the following week. In preparation, she had stocked her apartment with food. It was a clear Georgia evening, not as hot as had been expected. As usual, Richard left for the park at 4:45 P.M. and arrived at the AT&amp;T pavilion about 5:30. His stomach was bothering him; he was convinced that he had eaten a bad hamburger the day before. Lin Wood and Wayne Grant had arranged to take their children to Centennial Park that night. The park, in downtown Atlanta, stretches over 21 acres. There were air-conditioned tents, concerts on the stage, and hot-dog and souvenir stands. Downtown Atlanta was usually deserted in the oppressively hot, humid summer, but this year thousands of tourists filled the sidewalks, or sat on benches in the shade of some crape-myrtle trees, or cooled off by a fountain. Tour buses clogged the main arteries, and everyone complained that it took hours to get anywhere; stories were traded about athletes' getting to their competitions late because of the poor planning of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.

As always, Jewell was working the 12-hour night shift near the sound-and-light tower by the stage. He was pleased because one of his favorite groups—Jack Mack and the Heart Attack—was going to perform at 12:45. Jewell had a routine: he would check in and fill the ice chest he kept by a bench at his station. Jewell liked to offer water and Cokes to pregnant women or policemen who stopped to rest.

After he arrived at the park, his stomach cramps grew worse and he had a bout of diarrhea. At approximately 10 P.M. he took a break to go to the bathroom. The closest one was by the stage, but the security staff was not allowed to use it. ""I really have to go,"" Jewell says he told the stage manager. ""And he said, 'Well, O.K. this time.'""

When Jewell came out, he noticed that it was ""real calm"" and there wasn't much wind blowing. At that time of night, the crowd from Bud World became a little more raucous. Jewell was annoyed when he saw a group of drunks near his bench and beer cans littering the area beside the fence nearby. As he went to report the trash and the group that was carousing, he spotted a large olive-green military-style backpack, known as an Alice pack, under the bench. There had been a similar bag found the week before. Jewell later told an F.B.I. agent that he was annoyed that one of the drunks had tried to get into the lens of a camera crew. Jewell had told them to cut it out. ""They were running off at the mouth,"" Jewell would later tell Larry Landers of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (G.B.I.).

""I was light about the package at first,"" he told me, ""kidding around with Tom Davis from the G.B.I.: 'Well, are you going to open it?' At that point, it was not a concern. I was thinking to myself, Well, I am sure one of these people left it on the ground. When Davis came back and said, 'Nobody said it was theirs,' that is when the little hairs on the back of my head began to stand up. I thought, Uh-oh. This is not good.

""I never really had time to be frightened. My law-enforcement background paid off here. What went through my head was like a computer screen of this list I had to do. I had to call my supervisor. I have to tell people in the tower that something was going on. I have to be firm with them, stay calm, and be professional.""

Almost immediately, Jewell and Tom Davis cleared a 25-foot-square area around the backpack; Jewell made two trips into the tower to warn the technicians. ""I want y'all out now. This is serious.""

Two blocks away on Marietta Street,  approximately 300 editors, copywriters, and reporters from Cox newspapers around the country had taken over the extra desks in the new eighth-floor newsroom at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to prepare the special Olympics edition they put out each afternoon. The paper had gone ""Olympics-crazy,"" according to one reporter. The editor, Ron Martin, and the managing editor, John Walter—""WalMart,"" as they were called—had let it be known that no expense would be spared. Ann Hardie, who normally covers science, had been sent around the world to master the fine points of beach volleyball; Bill Rankin, officially on the federal-court beat, was assigned table tennis. The paper intended to set new standards in its hometown during the games, but in addition there was a hint of redemption in the air.

Since Cox newspaper executives had forced the resignation of the distinguished editor Bill Kovach in 1988, the paper had suffered a severe loss of reputation. ""We all felt just kind of beaten down,"" one reporter said. Kovach had been brought to Atlanta from The New York Times to elevate The A.J.C. into being the definitive paper of the New South, but eventually he irritated the local powers. Atlanta was inbred, a city of deals, and he resigned in a blaze of press outrage. Kovach now ran the Nieman journalism-fellowship program at Harvard, and the movie rights to his turbulent years in Atlanta—reported in these pages by Peter J. Boyer—had been sold to Warner Bros.

Within the profession, The A.J.C. had become something of a joke. More and more, its emphasis was on what John Walter called ""chunklets""—short bits in a soft-news style known as eye-candy. The paper published features on couples massage and how mushrooms grow in the rain. Walter had fired off several terse memos to ensure that there would be no more jumps of news stories to back pages and no more unsourced news stories, except on rare occasions. ""I don't see any reason why you can't report hard news in a short form,"" one editor told me.

The A.J. C. style of reporting in declarative sentences had a name, too: the voice of God. It was omniscient, because it allowed no references to unattributed sources. Subjects such as AIDS, which often required confidentiality, could not be covered properly in the paper, in the opinion of several reporters. The A.J.C. picked up news stories with unnamed sources from The New York Times, however, and reporters groused about the hypocrisy of the double standard.

On Saturday morning, July 27, Bob Johnson, the night metro editor, left the newsroom at one A.M. The sidewalks were still crowded; Johnson sat on a wall outside waiting for an A.J.C. shuttle bus to pick him up. About 1:25 he heard a strange noise. ""It sounded like an aerial bomb at a fireworks show,"" he said. He recalled thinking, Damn, that is sort of foolish. Then he heard screams and saw people running. Johnson rushed back upstairs to the almost deserted sixth-floor newsroom. Lyda Longa, a night police reporter, was still there. Johnson sent her down to the park and turned on the news, but nothing had moved across the wires. Just after two A.M., Longa called from the park. She told Johnson that one person had been killed and dozens were down—it was absolute chaos. Johnson could hear the sirens and the screams through the telephone; he began to type into his computer. ""We were trying to get a bullet into the street edition,"" Johnson recalled. In the crisis, it took only minutes for reporters to return to the newsroom; several had been at the park when the bomb went off. Rochelle Bozman, an Olympics editor, appeared and took over for Johnson. Soon John Walter was there, as was Bert Roughton, who would assist him in supervising the A.J.C. coverage of the bombing.

At the park, Jewell spoke with the first F.B.I. agents to arrive on the scene. The smell and the noise, he remembered, were overwhelming, and sensations blurred together. ""It was hard to describe the sound,"" he said. ""It was like what you hear in the movies. It was, like, KABOOM. I had seen an explosion in police training. We had ear protection when it went off. It smelled like a flash-bang grenade. The sky was not filled with black smoke, but grayish-white. All the shrapnel that was inside the package kept flying around, and some of the people got hit from the bench and some with metal.""

Bobi Jewell had just gone to sleep when the telephone rang. It was Richard. ""Mom, they had a bomb go off down here, but I am O.K. regardless of what the TV says."" He could hardly speak; he seemed paralyzed. Jewell did not mention to his mother that he had found the backpack and alerted Tom Davis. Bobi was perplexed. ""I thought, What does he mean?""

All night long she stayed on the foldout sofa watching the news reports. She was frightened by the ambulances, the noise, the bodies in the park.

Soon veteran homicide detectives in the  Atlanta police arrived at the bomb site. One sergeant was trying to make his way through the crowd when an Olympics official stopped him. ""Tell these cops to get the hell out of here,"" he said, according to a captain in the homicide division. ""Well, you get the fuck out of here. Who are you?"" the sergeant demanded. Agents from the Atlanta F.B.I. office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were in a shouting match over jurisdiction. ""We are handling this!"" one said. ""No, this is ours!"" an F.B.I. agent snapped.

In the command center at F.B.I. headquarters in northeastern Atlanta, there was complete pandemonium. The Olympics were a national convention for law enforcement. Some 30,000 security personnel were on hand. Over the next few days, there would be an internal debate: Who was going to be in charge of the bombing investigation? In Atlanta at that time were three veteran investigators with executive experience: Tom Fuentes, who is credited with helping to bring John Gotti to heel; Barry Mawn, who has worked extensively in organized-crime probes; and Robin Montgomery, the head of the critical-incident unit at Quantico, who at Ruby Ridge in 1992 questioned the disastrous ""rules of engagement"" which led to tragedy.

In the early-morning hours, F.B.I. agents picked up several suspects, including one referred to as ""the drunk in the bar."" According to F.B.I. sources, Louis Freeh himself got on the telephone to Barry Mawn. Freeh, a former F.B.I. agent, was personally monitoring the initial investigation by means of a series of conference calls from the command post at F.B.I. headquarters. He focused on ""the drunk in the bar,"" who had been making threats the night before, and within hours the information was leaked that the F.B.I. had a suspect. From Atlanta, Barry Mawn contacted his superiors in Washington. ""This suspect is not the bomber,"" he reportedly said, according to a former highlevel F.B.I. executive. Freeh allegedly lost his temper and belittled Mawn's professional abilities. He is said to have told Mawn that he ""had handled this all wrong."" The words one hears characterizing Freeh's telephone calls to the agents on duty in Atlanta are ""abusive,"" ""condescending,"" and ""dismissive."" A story went around the command center that Freeh was already saying, ""We have our man,"" according to a source in the bureau.

Watson Bryant was thinking, I cannot believe that I know anyone who throws pipe bombs into gopher holes.
Freeh made a decision: however experienced Montgomery, Fuentes, and Mawn were, this investigation would be run by Division 5 of the F.B.I., the National Security Division, a former counterintelligence unit that has been looking for a purpose since the Cold War ended. Trained in observation, division members rarely made a criminal case—their strength was intimidation and manipulation rather than the deliberate gathering of evidence to be presented in court. The F.B.I. promptly declared the bombing a terrorism case and placed it under the authority of Bob Bryant, head of the division. David Tubbs of Division 5 was sent to Atlanta to be the spokesman and to augment Woody Johnson, the Atlanta special agent in charge (S.A.C.), who had been trained in hostage rescue and who was awkward in press briefings. Tubbs was not as experienced in criminal cases as Mawn or Montgomery, who returned to Newark and Quantico, respectively, ""to get out of the line of fire,"" according to numerous F.B.I. sources. But Bryant and Freeh were reportedly micromanaging the S.A.C.'s and, later, the case agents Don Johnson and Diader Rosario.

On the morning of the bombing, Watson Bryant's alarm went off at six A.M. He was going to the Olympic kayak competition on the Ocoee River with Andy Currie, a friend from his Vanderbilt University days. He learned of the bombing on the radio as he was getting ready to go to Currie's house. ""Whoever has done this should be skinned alive,"" he told Currie. He spent the day in the country, and on Sunday he went out to run errands. When he got home, there was a message on his answering machine: ""Watson, this is Richard Jewell. You may have heard that I found the bomb and people are calling me a hero. Somebody told me I might get a book contract."" It had been years since Bryant had spoken to Jewell, but he did not immediately return the call; he was busy finishing up some contracts so that he could take a few days off to enjoy the Olympics.

In addition, Bryant was annoyed with Jewell. After Bryant had befriended him in their days at the Small Business Administration, Jewell had borrowed his new, $250 radar detector and never returned it. He had promised to pay him $100 for it, but he never had. In the meantime, Bryant's life had changed; he had set up an office as a solo practitioner. Bryant despised corporate politics and had no gift for them. His penchant for taking on pro-bono work for friends annoyed his wife, however. Bryant believed that Richard Jewell had attached himself to him years earlier because he lacked a father, but nevertheless Jewell could get on his nerves. By the summer of 1996, Bryant was preoccupied; his marriage had come apart two years earlier, and he was trying to sort out his life.

When he finally returned Jewell's phone call, he said, ""Well, damn it, where's my $100?"" Jewell laughed uneasily and told him about discovering the green backpack that contained the bomb. ""Didn't you see me on the news?"" Bryant reminded him that he rarely watched TV. ""I am proud of you, Richard,"" he said. ""About this book contract, I think it's far-fetched, but don't sign anything unless I see it first.""

In the Newsweek cover story detailing the bombing, published Monday, July 29, there was no mention of Richard Jewell. It said only that ""a security guard"" had alerted Tom Davis of the G.B.I. that no one had claimed the backpack under his bench. By the time Newsweek was on the stands, however, Jewell had been interviewed on CNN. The AT&amp;T publicity department had booked him on TV and told him to wear the shirt with the AT&amp;T logo. Jewell reluctantly agreed. ""The idea of going on TV made me nervous,"" he told me. ""I was not the hero. There were so many others who saved lives.""

In Demorest, Ray Cleere, the president of Piedmont College, was home on Saturday, July 27, watching CNN. Cleere had at one time been Mississippi's commissioner of higher education, but he was now posted at the rural Baptist mountain school. He was said to feel that he had suffered a loss of status in the boondocks, where he was out of the academic mainstream. He called Dick Martin, his chief of campus police. Shouldn't they call the F.B.I. and tell them about Richard Jewell? he asked. Cleere had had a strong disagreement with Jewell when one of the students was caught smoking pot. Jewell wanted to arrest him; Cleere said no. Cleere, Brad Mattear recalled, ""worried constantly about the image of the college."" According to Mattear, ""Cleere loved the limelight. He wanted public attention""—the very trait he reportedly ascribed to Richard Jewell.

Dick Martin, who was fond of Jewell, suggested a compromise, according to Lin Wood: he would call a friend in the G.B.I. Cleere then called the F.B.I. hot line in Washington himself. Wood says Cleere later complained that no one had seemed to want to listen to what he had to say about Richard Jewell. But his telephone call would trigger a complex set of circumstances in Habersham County, where F.B.I. investigators fanned out over the hills, attempting to uncover evidence that could lead to Jewell's arrest. ""The F.B.I. took his word, and what it actually did was get them both in a bunch of trouble,"" Mattear said. (Cleere has declined to comment.)

For Richard Jewell, Tuesday, July 30, would become a haze in which his life was turned upside down. ""The hours of the day ran so fast it is hard to remember what all happened,"" he told me. He started the day early at the Atlanta studio of the Today show. He was tired; the evening before he had had his friend Tim Attaway, a G.B.I. agent, for dinner. He had made lasagna and had drawn Attaway a diagram of the sound-and-light tower. Jewell had talked into the night about the bombing; only later would he learn that Attaway was wearing a wire.

Despite the late evening, Jewell was excited at the thought of meeting Katie Couric and being interviewed about finding the Alice pack in the park. His mother asked him to try to get Tom Brokaw's autograph. ""He was a man my mom respected a great deal,"" he said.

When he got back to the apartment, he was surprised to see a cluster of reporters in the parking lot. ""Do you think you are a suspect?"" one asked. Jewell laughed. ""I know they'll investigate anyone who was at the park that night,"" he said. ""That includes you-all too."" Jewell did not turn on the TV, but he noticed that the group outside the door continued to grow. At four that afternoon, Jewell received a phone call from Anthony Davis, the head of the security company Jewell worked for at AT&amp;T. ""Have you seen the news?"" Davis asked. ""They are saying you are a suspect."" Jewell said, ""They are talking to everybody."" According to Jewell, Davis said, ""They are zeroing in on you. To keep the publicity down, don't go to work.""

Within minutes, Don Johnson and Diader Rosario knocked on Jewell's door. They exuded sincerity, Jewell recalled. ""They told me they wanted me to come with them to headquarters to help them make a training film to be used at Quantico,"" he said. Johnson played to Jewell's pride. Despite the reporters in the parking lot and the call from Anthony Davis, Jewell had no doubt that they were telling the truth. He drove the short distance to F.B.I. headquarters in Buckhead in his own truck, but he noticed that four cars were following him. ""The press is on us,"" Jewell told Johnson when they arrived. ""No, those are our guys,"" Johnson told him. This tactic would continue through the next 88 days and be severely criticized: Why would you have an armada of surveillance vehicles stacked up on a suspected bomber?

It was then that Jewell started to wonder why he was at the F.B.I., but he followed Johnson and Rosario inside. Rosario was known for his skills as a negotiator; he had once helped calm a riot of Cuban prisoners in Atlanta. Johnson, however, had a reputation for overreaching. In Albany, New York, in 1987, he had pursued an investigation of then mayor Thomas Whalen. According to Whalen, the local U.S. attorney found no evidence to support Johnson's assertions and issued a letter to Whalen exonerating him completely, but Whalen believed it cost him an appointment as a federal judge.

As Jewell sat in a small office, he wondered why the cameraman recording the interview was staring at him so intently. After an hour, Johnson was called out of the room. When he returned, he said to Jewell, ""Let's pretend that none of this happened. You are going to come in and start over, and by the way, we want you to fill out this waiver of rights.""

""At that moment a million things were going through my head,"" Jewell told me. ""You don't give anyone a waiver of rights unless they are being investigated. I said, 'I need to contact my attorney,' and then all of a sudden it was an instant change. 'What do you need to contact your attorney for? You didn't do anything. We thought you were a hero. Is there something you want to tell us about?'"" Jewell grew increasingly apprehensive and later recalled thinking, These guys think I did this.

When the agents took a break, Jewell asked to use the phone. ""I called Watson four times. I called his brother. I told his parents that I had to get hold of Watson—it was urgent. I was, like, 'I have to speak to him right now.' What was going on was that Washington was on the phone with Atlanta. The people in Washington were giving them questions."" Jewell said he knew this because the videotapes in the cameras were two hours long and ""Johnson and Rosario would leave every 30 minutes, like they had to speak on the phone."" The O.RR. report, however, would assert that no one at headquarters knew about the videotaping or the training-film ruse. Lying to get a statement out of a suspect is, in fact, not illegal, but clearly Johnson and Rosario were not making decisions on their own. Even the procedure of having a fleet of cars follow a suspect was an intimidation tactic used by the F.B.I. Later, according to Jewell, Johnson and Rosario would both tell him privately that they believed he was innocent, but that the investigation was being run by the ""highest levels in Washington.""

Within the bureau, the belief is that during one of the telephone calls Freeh instructed Johnson and Rosario to read Jewell his Miranda rights. Freeh is said to have learned of Johnson's history from a member of his security detail, who had worked in Atlanta. He told Freeh that ""Johnson had a reputation for being obnoxious and a problem."" In addition, a week after Jewell's interview, Freeh reportedly received a call from Janet Reno, who had learned about the ruse from Kent Alexander, the local U.S. attorney, and Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick. Freeh wondered aloud how it was that, of all the agents in Atlanta, Johnson had been selected to work on the Jewell case. Like Jewell, Johnson had wound up in Atlanta because of his overzealous behavior—according to an F.B.I. source, the Whalen episode had resulted in a ""loss-of-effectiveness transfer,"" an F.B.I. euphemism. (Johnson declined to respond.)

On that same Tuesday, Watson Bryant and Nadya Light closed the office early and went to Centennial Park. Light, 35, a pretty Russian immigrant, had never met Radar, Bryant's old friend, and wanted to buy him a celebratory meal. Killing time until Jewell came on duty, they went into the House of Blues and then bought some hot sauce. Walking toward his car, Bryant saw newsboys hawking the afternoon edition of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""It was like out of a cartoon. They were all yelling!"" he recalled. ""I caught the headline out of the corner of my eye."" The headline read: FBI SUSPECTS 'HERO' GUARD MAY HAVE PLANTED BOMB.

Bryant borrowed 50 cents from Light to buy the paper and began to read: '""Richard Jewell, 33 . . . fits the profile of the lone bomber.' I could not believe it.""

At that moment, Bryant's brother, Bruce, who was on his way to the diving competition, got a call from Jewell. ""Where is Watson?"" As Bruce Bryant walked past a Speedo billboard with a TV screen, he saw Richard Jewell's face filling the screen. ""Oh, my God,"" he said to his wife. At the same moment, Watson was in his car a block away on Northside Drive when he too noticed the Speedo screen. He could not get back to his house—the streets were blocked off for the cycling competition. From his car he called F.B.I. headquarters and demanded to speak to Jewell. ""He is not here,"" the operator said. From his home phone, he picked up his messages and heard Jewell's low, urgent tones. ""He didn't leave a number,"" Bryant told Light. ""Call Star 69,"" she said. The number came back: 679-9000, the number for F.B.I. headquarters, which he had just dialed. Within minutes, Bryant had Jewell on the phone. Jewell told him he was making a training film. ""You idiot! You are a suspect. Get your ass out of there now!"" Bryant told him.

Before The Atlanta Journal-Constitution broke the story of Richard Jewell, there had been a debate in the newsroom over whether or not to name him. One block away, CNN's Art Harris and Henry Schuster had alerted the network's president that Jewell was targeted, but they held the story, because they understood its potential magnitude. At The A.J.C., Kathy Scruggs, a police reporter, who had allegedly gotten a tip from a close friend in the F.B.I., got a confirmation from someone in the Atlanta police. According to the managing editor, John Walter, the first edition of the paper that Tuesday had a brief profile of Jewell. It was dropped in later editions as Walter questioned whether the paper had enough facts to support the scoop. Because of the voice-of-God style, the paper ended up making a flat-out statement: ""Richard Jewell . . . fits the profile of the lone bomber.""

When I asked John Walter about the lone-bomber sentence, he said, ""I ultimately edited it. . . . One of the tests we put to the material is, is it a verifiable fact?"" One editor added, ""The whole story is voice-of-God. . . . Because we see this event taking place, the need to attribute it to sources—F.B.I. or law enforcement—is less than if there is no public acknowledgment."" John Walter indicated that he had not seen a lone-bomber profile. I asked him, ""Whose profile of a lone bomber does Richard Jewell fit? Where is the 'says who' in this sentence?"" Walter said that he felt comfortable with the assertion.

The page-one story had a double byline: Kathy Scruggs and Ron Martz. Walter had told these two early on that they would be the reporters assigned to any Olympic catastrophe. Martz, who had covered the Gulf War, had been assigned the security beat for the Olympics; Scruggs routinely covered local crime. Scruggs had good contacts in the Atlanta police, and she was tough. She was characterized as ""a police groupie"" by one former staff member. ""Kathy has a hard edge that some people find offensive,"" one of her editors told me, but he praised her skills. Police reporters are often ""dictation pads"" for local law enforcement; recently the American Journalism Review sharply criticized The A.J. C. for the scanty confirmation and lack of skepticism in its coverage of Jewell.

The newsroom atmosphere resembled that at F.B.I. headquarters; there was a frenzy to be first. Kent Walker, a newsroom intern, published a story in the same edition, with a glaring mistake in the headline: BOMB SUSPECT HAD SOUGHT LIMELIGHT, PRESS INTERVIEWS. Since Ray Cleere's tip to the F.B.I., the ""hero bomber"" theory had been circulating among Atlanta law enforcement officers. Maria Elena Fernandez, a reporter, was sent to Habersham County on July 29. By coincidence, William Rathburn, the head of security for the Olympics, had been at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984 when a fake bomb was found on a bus—left by a policeman who sought attention.

On the surface, the story had an irresistible newsroom logic: Jewell was clearly looking for recognition. Bert Roughton, the city editor, had answered the telephone when a representative from AT&amp;T called to ask if the paper would like a Jewell interview. According to Walter, Roughton himself typed a sentence in the Scruggs-and-Martz piece: ""He [Jewell] also has approached newspapers, including The Atlanta JournalConstitution, seeking publicity for his actions."" But he hadn't. Walter explained, ""There was nothing wrong with that sentence. That's journalistically proper. It is not common practice, to my knowledge, to ask someone you are interviewing . . . 'Are you here of your own free will?'"" Jewell had not contacted the paper—a fact which would have been easy enough to check. Walter became snappish when I described the sentence as ""a mistake."" ""It was not a mistake,"" he said angrily. Scruggs and Martz quoted Piedmont College president Ray Cleere as backup. According to Cleere, Jewell had been ""a little erratic"" and ""almost too excitable.""

There was no doubt raised by The A.J.C. about the value of Cleere's information or the fragility of the F.B.I.'s potential case. On Tuesday morning, July 30, Christina Headrick, a young intern on the paper, was sent to Buford Highway to stake out Richard Jewell's apartment. She phoned in that there were men doing surveillance. By deadline, John Walter had made a decision: he would tear up the afternoon Olympics edition and lead with Jewell.

Several states away, Colonel Robert  Ressler was watching CNN when the A.J.C. extra edition was shown. Ressler, who was retired from the behavioral-science unit of the F.B.I., had, along with John Douglas, developed the concept of criminal-personality profiling. He was the co-author of the Crime Classification Manual, which is used by the F.B.I. He had interviewed Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and John Wayne Gacy, and as he watched the TV report, he was mystified. ""They were talking about an F.B.I. profile of a hero bomber, and I thought, What F.B.I. profile? It rather surprised me."" According to Ressler, the definition of ""hero homicide""—a person looking for recognition without an intent to kill— perhaps emerged as ""hero bomber."" ""There is no such classification as the hero bomber,"" he told me recently. ""This was a myth."" Later he said, ""It occurred to me that there was no database of any bomber who lived with his mother, was a security guard and unmarried. How many hero bombers had we ever encountered? Only one that I know of, in Los Angeles, and his bomb did not go off."" Ressler knew that something was off; profiles are developed from a complex set of evidence and facts derived only in part from a crime scene. The bomb had been deadly, which was not consistent with the ""hero complex."" Furthermore, he wondered, where did they get the information to put the profile together that fast? He asked himself, What came first here, the chicken or the egg? Was the so-called profile actually developed from the circumstances, or was it invented for Richard Jewell?

When Jewell returned home from  F.B.I. headquarters just before eight P.M., NBC was showing special Olympic coverage. He sat on the sofa and watched Tom Brokaw say, ""They probably have enough to arrest him right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always want to have enough to convict him as well. There are still holes in this case.""

Jewell knew that Brokaw was his mother's favorite newsman; he looked at her and noticed ""the color and the blood flow out of her face when she heard that."" Bobi turned to him and asked, ""What is he talking about?"" Jewell later recalled, ""Brokaw was talking about her son as a murderer. . . . She started crying, and what am I going to say to her? 'Mom, Watson is going to fix this'? What do you say? She doesn't hear anything anyway—she was in hysterics."" At that point, Jewell said, he broke down as well.

The day Watson Bryant inadvertently became the lead lawyer for Richard Jewell, he was an attorney whom almost no one in the Atlanta legal establishment had ever heard of. ""Who the hell is Watson Bryant?"" a caption in the daily legal sheet, the Fulton County Daily Report, would read after he had appeared on the Today show. Bryant understood Jewell's vulnerability and decided on a strategy: he would treat him as a member of his own family. In Atlanta, the Bryants were a clan: Watson's father, Goble Bryant, had been a West Point tackle, on the 1949 college all-star team; his grandfather had invented a process for putting handles on paper bags. Watson had partied through Vanderbilt University and had barely gotten accepted to law school at the University of South Carolina. He had a close relationship with his brother, Bruce, and their sister, Barbara Ann, and if he lacked staff at his office, he knew he could count on his family to pick up the slack. Bruce enlisted Jewell to help coach his junior football team; Watson had a picnic for Richard and Bobi at his parents' house at the Atlanta Country Club.

When Bryant arrived at the Jewells' apartment that night, he pushed his way through the crowd standing outside in the spongy Atlanta humidity. Microphones were shoved in his face. ""What is happening, Watson?"" Bobi asked him. Bryant asked Jewell to speak to him alone. ""I want to know if you can tell me, without any hesitation at all, if you had anything to do with the bombing,"" he said. ""I didn't,"" Jewell told him. ""I said, 'I am going to ask you again.' He would not look me in the eye. I said, 'Don't give me this ""sir"" shit.' I said, 'Richard, these people want to kill you. I cannot help you unless you tell me the absolute, unequivocal truth.' I was in his face. He said he did not have anything to do with it."" Jewell was bewildered and numb, said Bryant, who left at 10:30 P.M. At midnight, Jewell called him to say, ""They are massing outside the apartment, Watson.""

The next morning, Bryant went from talk show to talk show, starting with NBC. With the notable exception of The New York Times, virtually every newspaper in the country had picked up the A.J.C. story and run it as front-page news. There were 10,000 reporters in Atlanta; the Los Angeles Times would later call the squad bearing down on the Jewells ""a massive strike force . . . Tora! Tora! Tora!"" Bryant was in a daze, but he held his own. ""Is it true that Jewell was at some time ordered to seek psychological counseling?"" Bryant Gumbel asked him. ""I know a lot of people that ought to have psychological counseling,"" Watson Bryant replied.

By 10 A.M. he was back at the Jewells' apartment, studying a search warrant that had been delivered that day. The F.B.I., Jewell recalled, said that he could not be inside the apartment during the search. Bryant called F.B.I. headquarters: ""What the hell is this? Why can't he be there?"" Within an hour, at least 40 members of the F.B.I. had arrived, with dogs. ""There was a physical-evidence team. There was a scientific team. There was a team for the bomb-squad people, and then the A.T.F. . . . They all had different-color shirts. Light blue for bombs, dark blue for evidence protection, red and yellow."" Bryant could not believe what he was seeing. ""This is like damn Six Flags over Georgia,"" he told them.

""I kept saying to Watson, 'I didn't do this.' And he said, 'Hey, kid, I believe you—we are doing what we can.'"" Jewell was a gun collector. Bryant was sharp with him: ""You get all those guns out of your closets and put them on your bed. We don't want any trouble.""

For seven hours, Jewell sat outside on the staircase in what has become one of the most famous images of last summer. Bryant had to take his daughter, Meredith, to the Olympic equestrian competition, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for her. As he left, he said, ""Don't do anything stupid. Just shut up and let them do what they have to do."" Hours passed as Jewell sat in the heat. ""Finally I decided I would ask them if I could go in and use the rest room. They said, 'We got the order a couple of hours ago you could come in; you just can't get in our way.'"" Jewell was told he had to wear rubber socks and gloves in order not to contaminate the site. The Jewell apartment is small—two bedrooms with a bathroom in between, a living room, an alcove dining room that has been turned into a den. As Jewell sat on the sofa, he thought he heard a crash in his bedroom. ""I thought my CD player was on the floor, and I said, 'What are you-all tearing up?' and they said, 'You can't go in there right now; we are searching.' I said, 'I want to know what you-all just broke.'"" One search warrant listed some 200 items the F.B.I. could confiscate, including ""magazines, books . . . and photographs which would include descriptive information such as telephone numbers, addresses, affiliations and contact points of individuals involved in a conspiracy to manufacture, transport and . . . detonate . . . the explosive device used in the bombing at the Olympic Centennial Park on July 27, 1996.""

""They had all my pictures, all the stuff that was in the drawers. My personal things. How would you like to know that 12 different guys had been in your underwear, laid it out on the floor, probably walked on it and then folded it back up like nothing ever happened and put it in your drawer? So then Mom got to go and watch it on TV: 'Live from the Jewell house, the search continues. . . . We are expecting an arrest any minute.'""

When Bobi Jewell returned home, the apartment appeared neat, until she walked into her kitchen. She looked down at her counters, where all her condiments, dog biscuits, spices, and crackers had been taken out of their Tupperware containers and placed in Ziploc bags. She began to cry. And then she went into the bedroom and ""immediately started washing clothes,"" Jewell said.

Driving home from the equestrian events, Bryant heard the live coverage of the search on the radio. ""Why are you helping this guy if he's guilty?"" Meredith asked.

The next morning, Bryant received a copy of the F.B.I. inventory of articles confiscated in the apartment. On the list he was stunned to see ""one hollowed-out hand grenade, ball-shaped"" and ""one hollowed-out hand grenade, pinecone-shaped."" ""What the hell is this?"" he asked Jewell. ""They were paperweights,"" Jewell said. ""I bought them at a military store."" ""Oh, shit,"" Bryant said.

For the first few days, the Jewells lived  on ham omelettes; a neighbor had brought them half a ham from the Honey Baked Ham Company on Buford Highway. Bobi Jewell had a vacation scheduled, so she remained at home, lying on the bed and ""listening to the ball game if it was on."" For two weeks, she cleaned out her bureau drawers. Richard would spend the day watching CNN or movies such as Backdraft and Midnight Run. ""I would look out the window and see about 150 to 200 press people. Then it would drop to five or six on the hill. They had one person sitting up there at all times with their binoculars."" Richard believed they were being monitored. ""They heard everything that was going on. They were over there with high-intensity zoom lenses. They had people over there who could read lips. They had a sound dish. They could hear everything that we said. They had a person writing down everything we said. I saw them.""

When Bobi walked out the door, Jewell said, they would holler obscenities and yell, 'You should both die'
Once, Bobi's cat jumped on the window ledge under the curtain and the photographers began frenetically shooting pictures, believing that one of the Jewells was in the window. Sound trucks and boom microphones prevented the neighbors from getting near the apartment. Three F.B.I. agents were usually sitting near the tiny swimming pool; each time Jewell or his mother left the house, a cavalcade of unmarked cars would follow. Richard soon began to write a speech describing the horror he felt at being falsely accused. He ate grilled-cheese sandwiches, huge pans of lasagna, and can after can of Campbell's tomato soup.

""If my mom and I had something we wanted to talk about that we didn't want anyone to hear, we wrote it on pieces of paper. When she left to go to work the next day, she would take it with her, tear it up, and put it in the trash! That is how I kept my mother informed about what was going on with the case."" The notes were specific: ""What the Justice Department was saying, what my attorneys were hearing through the grapevine that I could tell my mom that was not privileged. It was mainly stuff like 'Keep the faith' and 'Can I borrow $10 for gas in the truck?' ""

Jewell described how, when his mother would walk out the door, ""they would holler obscenities at her. They would yell, 'Did he do it? Did he blow those people up?' They would yell, 'You should both die.'"" According to Jewell, ""The cameramen were just trying to get us aggravated so they could get it on camera. You don't know how hard it is when they are saying stuff about my mother and me. . . . All she was trying to do was walk her dog. And she cannot do that without hearing that yelling. When someone did that to my mother, I would want to be up on the hill calling the police, because I would want them arrested. I was going to say, 'Mom, tell me which one said that!' And I was going to walk up to that person and introduce myself and say, 'Hi, my name is Richard Jewell. What is yours? Who do you work for? Who is your supervisor?' And I was going to go home and call 911 to get a warrant.""

By disposition, Jewell is a night person, but he would get up early when his mother went back to work and make her breakfast. By 11 A.M. he would be playing Mortal Kombat II and listening to 96 Rock on the radio, where one of his friends is a disc jockey. Four days into his period of captivity, he called the DeKalb County police. He recalled telling a Mr. Brown, ""'This is Richard Jewell. I am sure you are aware of my situation over on Buford Highway.' He said, 'Yes, Richard, I know.' I said, 'I just want to tell you my situation. Number one: I did not do this. Number two: I am here and I am not leaving the apartment for any reason at all.' I said that all the press was doing right now was aggravating my mother and disturbing my neighbors, and I would really appreciate it if the neighbors could return to a normal life.""

On Saturday, August 3, as Bryant stared at the F.B.I. agent plucking Jewell's hair, he had already made a decision. ""It was, like, screw it. I had had it."" The next day was the closing ceremony of the Olympics; Bryant imagined that that would be the day the government might choose to arrest Jewell. ""Who is the best criminal lawyer in Georgia?"" he asked a state lawyers' association. Within a day, he had brought in Jack Martin, an expert on the federal death penalty and a Harvard law school graduate with close ties to the local U.S. attorney, Kent Alexander. ""Let me tell you something about myself,"" Jewell told him in their first meeting. ""I hate criminal lawyers."" ""Well, Richard,"" Martin said, ""I don't much like cops, but sometimes I need one, and this is a time you sure need a criminal lawyer.""

That weekend, watching the Olympic basketball finals, Bryant had an idea: he wanted to be prepared with his own polygraph test of Jewell if the F.B.I. arrested him. From the game, Bryant called a close friend who was a former federal prosecutor. ""Try Richard Rackleff,"" he said. ""We worked together on the Walter Moody bombing case."" Rackleff had recently set up a private practice, and he agreed to test Jewell the next day. On Sunday morning, Bryant was up early, unable to sleep. He drove around town, making calls from his cell phone. He dialed 679-9000—the F.B.I. ""This is Watson Bryant. I am going to pick up Richard Jewell. I just want you to know that. I don't have a white Bronco. I don't have a wig, and I don't have cash in my car. We are just going to my office.""

Watson had coordinated an elaborate plan with his brother to dodge reporters; he would use a decoy and snake through a parking garage. Rackleff had been instructed to park blocks from Bryant's office, because his car could be identified easily, since he was well known in Atlanta law enforcement.

When Rackleff sat down with Richard Jewell in the conference room, he later told me, he sensed almost immediately that Jewell was innocent. Rackleff had tested many bombers before, including Walter Moody, who was convicted of killing a federal judge. ""They are strange ducks—they leave their attorneys cold,"" Rackleff said. Although no one knew Rackleff was in the building, more than 100 reporters gathered outside to get a look at Jewell. Inside, Jack Martin, Bryant, Nadya Light, and Jewell spent 12 hours in Bryant's office. Rackleff asked Jewell a series of questions, but the test was inconclusive. ""Richard is tormented. He is exploding on the inside,"" Rackleff said. While he was testing him, CNN's Art Harris was visible through the window of Bryant's office, but he could not see inside. Bryant was thoroughly deflated, close to despair. ""You have got to try to buck Richard up,"" Rackleff told him. ""Who is going to buck me up?"" Bryant asked.

'We are not in missile range of arresting Richard Jewell, but we want him to take our own polygraph,"" Kent Alexander told Bryant and Jack Martin in their first meeting on the case. In the meantime, Rackleff had tested Jewell again, and he had passed with ""no deception,"" the highest rating. By this time, it was clear that there was no damning evidence against Jewell discovered at the apartment or in his old house in Habersham County.

Alexander was only 38, but he had been groomed for politics in a fancy local family. His father was a senior partner in a good Atlanta law firm, and he had worked as an intern for Senator Sam Nunn. Bryant worried about Alexander's lack of experience, but Alexander told colleagues that he was disturbed by the lack of substantial evidence against Jewell. He was trying to operate with decency, but he was cautious and had to check every detail with Washington.

Bryant, however, didn't trust Alexander; he had had a bad experience with Alexander's predecessor. In 1990, Bryant had almost been put out of business in a tussle with the then U.S. attorney. The local Small Business Administration accused a bank Bryant represented of improper use of funds; the bank blamed Bryant, who was brought before a grand jury and over the next two years almost lost his practice. He spent $50,000 defending himself, and Nadya Light had to take another job, but eventually the case was settled with Bryant's agreeing not to do business with the S.B.A. for 18 months. Bryant had always felt that he had been manhandled by the office. ""I learned everything I needed to know about dealing with this office in 1990,"" Bryant recalled telling Alexander. ""No polygraph for Richard.""

At the meeting, Alexander told Bryant and Martin, ""This is all off-the-record. This is a request that is strictly confidential."" Weeks later, Louis Freeh came to town to address a breakfast of former F.B.I. agents. Almost immediately, the polygraph request was reported on CNN. ""Kent, I thought we had an agreement,"" Bryant told him. ""I cannot control Washington,"" Alexander said.

When two of the bomb-blast victims sued Richard Jewell, Bryant brought in Wood and Grant to handle the civil litigation. Martin opposed the move. He believed in the cone of silence: ""Circle the wagons and don't speak."" He said that Wood and Grant had a different perspective: Attack, attack, and if you give any quarter, it is a sign of weakness. Martin had been reassured in private by Kent Alexander that Jewell was not in any immediate danger of being arrested, but the team disagreed about press tactics. Martin worked through the Atlanta-establishment back channels; Lin Wood was a rhetoric man. He favored ""one big newsbreak a week."" ""You know who wrote the book Masters of Deceit? J. Edgar Hoover! And that was about the Communist Party in America. So now they have gone from masters of investigation to masters of deceit!"" he would routinely tell reporters who called.

Three days after Wood and Grant surfaced as the two new civil lawyers, a Ford van with a tinted bubble-shaped window appeared on the top level of the Macy's parking garage which faced the conference-room windows of their offices. According to Wood, the van did not move for 10 days. ""We used to sit there and wave at it."" Then the lawyers placed a camera in the window, and the next day the vehicle was gone. ""For sure that van had laser sound-detecting equipment,"" Wood said.

Jewell was annoyed that press descriptions of him always emphasized his ""overzealousness""; he considers himself a man of details. Often, when he's watching movies at home, he freeze-frames in order to study props in scenes. The second weekend he was considered a suspect, he told me, ""I walked in and I noticed white powder all over the telephone table in the conference room."" It was a Saturday morning, and Jewell had been with his lawyers until late the night before. He told me he was convinced that the F.B.I. ""had lifted a ceiling tile,"" and that the white powder was ""dust that came down."" Bryant and Jewell made light of it and did not sweep their phones, believing that any tap the F.B.I. would use would be of a laser or satellite variety and impossible to trace. ""In the beginning of every conversation, Watson would curse for about a minute and tell them what lowlives they were. And then he would say, 'By the way, this is Richard's lawyer. Y'all can cut your tape players off,""' Jewell said. ""I would call them dirty scumbags,"" said Bryant. But the local U.S. attorney, Kent Alexander, insisted that their phones were not tapped. ""There are no wiretap warrants,"" he said.

The F.B.I. did turn up one bit of potentially troublesome evidence in the Jewells' apartment—fragments of a fence that had been blown up in the explosion. After a telephone conversation with Watson Bryant, Kathy Scruggs quoted him saying, ""Yes, he did have a sample of the blown-up bomb."" Bryant accused her of egregiously misquoting him. He remembered saying to her, ""Yes, Richard had souvenirs of the bombing."" Scruggs had not taped their conversation. ""She cut the 'ing' off of 'bomb,'"" Bryant later told me, but Scruggs strongly denies this. The day the story broke, Bryant criticized Scruggs on local radio. That afternoon she appeared at his office to attempt to clear up the misunderstanding. ""I don't like your reporting,"" Bryant recalled telling her. ""I'm human, too,"" she said. The next day, Ron Martz inserted a quote from Bryant in an unrelated news story: ""Oh, man, it's not even a scrap of the bomb—it's a piece of damned fence, for God's sake."" But the quote would have little impact. Scruggs's version had been picked up; gathering force, it was eventually related by Bill Press on Crossfire on the evening of October 28: ""The guy was seen with a homemade bomb at his home a few days before."" (The next day CNN would be forced to apologize for the mistake.)

By this time Bryant had grown enraged by the media coverage. The New York Post had called Jewell ""a Village Rambo"" and ""a fat, failed former sheriff's deputy."" Jay Leno had said that Jewell ""had a scary resemblance to the guy who whacked Nancy Kerrigan,"" and asked, ""What is it about the Olympic Games that brings out big fat stupid guys?"" The A.J. C. s star columnist, Dave Kindred, had compared Jewell to serial murderer Wayne Williams: ""Like this one, that suspect was drawn to the blue lights and sirens of police work. Like this one, he became famous in the aftermath of murder.""

Television journalism was also a revelation to Bryant; he felt he had ""landed on Mars,"" and spent hours channel-surfing. On CNN, one criminologist said ""it was possible"" that Jewell had a hero complex. Bryant told his brother, Bruce, ""I know I am going to sue someone. I just don't know who."" Bruce Bryant searched for Jewell's name on the Internet three weeks into his ordeal and found 10,000 stories. The tone many of the journalists took was accusatory and pre-determined, with a few rare exceptions, such as that of CBS correspondent Jim Stewart. ""Don't jump to any conclusion yet,"" he said sharply in a broadcast at the height of the frenzy.

In his first week as Jewell's lawyer, Bryant went to the CNN studio to be interviewed by Larry King. After the broadcast, he was asked to stop in at the office of CNN president Tom Johnson. ""They wanted to know what I thought of their reporting so far."" Art Harris was in the room. ""I turned around and I said to Art Harris, 'Who the hell are you and the rest of the media to make fun of how Richard Jewell and his mother live? Who are you to make fun of working people who live in a $470-a-month apartment? Is there something wrong with that? Who are you to say that he is a weirdo because he lives with his mother?' ""

According to Jack Martin, the F.B.I. spent weeks on one erroneous early theory—that Richard Jewell was an enraged homosexual cop-hater who had been aided in the bombing by his lover. Jewell had purportedly planted the bomb; the lover then made the 911 phone call warning that it would go off in Centennial Park. The rationale behind this idea was that Jewell was ""mad at the cops and wanted to kill other cops,"" Martin told me.

The rumor began at Piedmont College, perhaps invented by several of the students Jewell had turned in for smoking pot, but it had a chilling consequence. In mid-August, three agents appeared at the Curtis Mathes video store in Cornelia, where Chris Simmons, a senior at Piedmont, worked part-time. Simmons, a friend of Jewell's, who was engaged to be married, was a B student, but he displayed the same porcine blankness as Jewell and spoke in a slow drawl. He had a deep distrust of the government and carried a card in his pocket that read: CHRISTOPHER DWAYNE SIMMONS-CAMPAIGN SUPPORT FOR CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES.

The agents questioned Simmons in the store for one and a half hours. ""They asked me if I was a homosexual. They asked me if I had accessed the Internet. . . . They later wanted to wire me. They said, 'If he is really a hero, we will find out, and if not, he has killed someone and injured a lot of people.' "" Simmons was short with the agents and denied everything. They accused him of lying and said they could take him to Atlanta. The agents told someone Simmons had once worked with that Simmons might be involved in the bombing. ""They kept wording questions differently. They kept saying: Do you think Richard Jewell could have done this if he believed that he could get people out in time and nobody would get hurt?"" Simmons later called one of the F.B.I. agents and said, ""I hear you don't believe my story."" He recalled their conversation: "" 'I think you are sugarcoating your answers,' he said. I said, 'Next time I talk with you, it will be with a lawyer.' And he asked me if I was threatening him. Then he hung up on me."" Ultimately, Simmons volunteered to take a polygraph, which he says he passed. ""I was a nervous wreck,"" he said. ""I had only seen this on TV.""

What was not known outside a small circle of investigators was how deadly the Centennial Park bomb really was. It was well constructed, with a piece of metal shaped like a V, and inside, it had canisters filled with nails and screws. Jack Martin, who had spent time in Vietnam, compared its construction to that of a claymore mine, a sophisticated and lethal device. The bomb weighed more than 40 pounds. It was ""a shaped charge,"" F.B.I. deputy director Weldon Kennedy would announce in December. It could blast out fragments from three separate canisters, but only one of the canisters exploded on July 27. Someone had moved the Alice pack slightly before the bomb detonated, causing most of the shrapnel to shoot into the sky. The composition of the bomb did not suggest the work of an amateur, Kathy Scruggs would ironically later report, after interviewing an A.T.F. chemist.

As the weeks went by, Richard Jewell  withdrew into a state of psychological limbo; he began to try to analyze what the agents might think of his behavior within the small apartment. ""I would be watching a spy show on TV or something like a John Wayne movie. Someone would be talking about blowing something up, and I would think to myself, My God, that is going to sound really bad if they think I am listening to that."" He worried that ""they would think I was some kind of a nut,"" and often, when he could not sleep, he would find himself consciously switching to exercise videos and soap operas.

Over Labor Day weekend, he drove up to Habersham County for a picnic with his ex-girlfriend's family, the Chastains. As usual, three F.B.I. cars followed him, but he had gotten adept at picking out the unmarked vehicles. As Jewell drove into town, he noticed that white ribbons hung from hundreds of trees; the Chastains had organized a campaign in his behalf. On the way home, Jewell drove with his friend Dave Dutchess. For the first time, he did not see an F.B.I. car following him, but he noticed an airplane flying low overhead. He drove another 20 miles, and the plane was still on him. ""I said, 'Dave, do you think the F.B.I. would be following us in an airplane? It wouldn't be that hard to do, if they put some kind of beeper on the car.'"" The plane followed them through Gainesville all the way to Atlanta—an hour's drive. ""Just to make sure, we got off on an exit ramp and went about five miles back north. And I got out and took a picture. They followed us all the way back to the apartment! And they circled the apartment for about 15 minutes, until the F.B.I. car showed back up. I got very emotional. My cheeks got beet red. And Mom came home and said, 'What is going on? What is the matter?' It just destroyed the whole day.""

On September 2, Dave Dutchess and his fiancee, Beatty, were driving to their house in Tennessee. It was raining hard, and they noticed they were being followed by several F.B.I. cars. The storm grew worse, and they stopped at a hotel for the night. The next day, while getting coffee at a McDonald's, they were surrounded by F.B.I. agents. ""We just want to talk to you. We are trying to be discreet."" One agent, Dutchess recalled, spoke into his radio: ""We have the suspect in hand."" As they walked back toward their car, Dutchess said to Beatty, ""They think I am his accomplice. I heard on the news they were looking for his accomplice!""

After the interview, which lasted several hours, Dutchess spoke to Watson Bryant. ""What did they ask you that concerns you?"" Bryant asked him. ""Well, I decided that I had to tell them the truth. Me and one of my friends used to set off pipe bombs for fun,"" Dutchess told him. ""What?"" Bryant exclaimed, incredulous. ""Yeah, I told them we liked to throw pipe bombs down gopher holes when we lived out in West Virginia.""

""Did Richard know this friend?"" Bryant asked apprehensively. ""Hell, no. He never met him,"" Dutchess said, but Bryant knew that this could prolong the F.B.I.'s investigation perhaps by months. ""I hung up and I was thinking, I cannot believe that I even know anyone who throws pipe bombs into gopher holes.""

As part of their strategy, Wood and Grant decided to mount a strong counterattack against the government. Wayne Grant had come up with the idea: Bobi Jewell should hold a press conference during the Democratic convention and make a direct plea to Bill Clinton. The day before she was to appear, Grant rehearsed her. It was difficult to work with Bobi; she was exhausted and could not stop crying. Confined under siege for almost a month, she could not see an end to it, since every day brought a new humiliation. The resident manager had threatened to take away their lease, and the manager's son was out selling pictures he took of them. A close friend from church was dying, Bobi said, and Richard could not go to see him, because of the swarm of F.B.I. agents and reporters who followed him everywhere. All of it came out in a rush in the conference room with Wayne Grant: Bobi had even had to give Bryant and Nadya Light the Olympic-basketball tickets she had won as colleague of the year, and every night she and her son were stuck together, staring at each other across the kitchen table. They were often irritable, and Richard sometimes lost his temper. ""Mother, just shut up,"" he would tell her when she nagged him about the case. Then, Bobi later recalled, she would go into her bedroom and lie on the four-poster bed hoping that the photographers who rented an apartment across the way for $1,000 a day had no way of knowing what was going on.

Grant kept careful notes on the session. Bobi was terrified about appearing in front of cameras. She sobbed and told him, ""If I go on TV Monday, I'll be embarrassed. It will be, like, whenever I go anywhere, people will be looking at me: 'Did he do it or didn't he do it?' ""

""If you talked to the person who is in charge of the investigation, what would you say?"" Grant asked her calmly. Bobi's voice was halting, but she was firm: ""He is innocent. Clear his name and let us get back to a life that is normal.""

A few weeks later, Wayne Grant went to a party for a Bar Mitzvah, and a guest cornered him. She asked him if he had told Bobi Jewell to cry at the end of her press conference, and then added coldly, ""Nice touch.""

The lawyers' strategy worked: after Bobi's press conference, the Jewells were deluged with interview requests. Bryant often received 100 phone calls a day. Bobi soon developed a system: letters from Oprah Winfrey, Sally Jessy Raphael, and TV producers were stacked on the console in the living room; flowers and baskets of Godiva chocolates and cheese and crackers from the networks were sent to the offices of Wood &amp; Grant and then on to a children's hospital.

At the U.S. Attorney's Office, it had become increasingly clear to Kent Alexander that something had to be done about Richard Jewell. Janet Reno had seen Bobi Jewell on TV and was moved by her sincerity. Privately, Reno and Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick were said to be concerned about the heavy-handed tactics of the F.B.I. ""The case had become a total embarrassment,"" a Justice Department official told me, but Alexander was in a complicated situation. He was working closely with the F.B.I., and there was no sign that the bureau was ready to let go, despite growing consternation among the local agents that the Washington command center had mishandled the case. And there was another problem: Alexander did not trust Lin Wood.

By late September, there was a tremendous strain within the team Bryant had hastily assembled. The other lawyers accused Jack Martin of cutting private deals with his friend Kent Alexander, pulling focus, and not being tough enough. For his part, Alexander, according to Martin, admired Bryant even though he believed he was a loose cannon, but he was fed up with Lin Wood.

""Alexander would say something fairly candid to me, and I would report it to the attorneys, and the next day he would see it on TV,"" said Jack Martin. ""Alexander had checked out Lin, and he knew that he was a take-no-prisoners guy."" The lawyers often argued among themselves. Wood insisted on a full-blowout press-attack strategy. Bryant had mastered his sound bite: ""The F.B.I. is a 500-pound gorilla who will kick the shit out of anyone."" Martin wanted the lawyers to ease up on the hyperbole: ""I would say, 'We do not need to do this.' And Lin would say, 'Let's go public with this.' He was manic about it."" In one argument, Wood told him, ""Goddamn it, Martin, you're like my ex-wives. There isn't anything you can say I won't object to.""

There was an atmosphere of extreme apprehension between Bryant and Jewell as they drove to F.B.I. headquarters on the afternoon of October 6. They were on their way to what would seemingly be a session with conclusional overtones, but Jewell was worried: What if this meeting was a trick? It was difficult to believe that the bureau was really ending its two-month-long investigation into his life. For weeks, Jack Martin and Bryant had been going back and forth with Kent Alexander. Finally, Jewell had agreed to an unusual suggestion: if he submitted to a lengthy voluntary interview with the bureau, and if Division 5 was satisfied, then perhaps the Justice Department could issue a letter publicly stating that he was no longer a suspect. Jewell tried to imagine the questions he would be asked. ""I wanted to look at everything from their angle,"" he told me, ""trying to assess it and reassess it in my head.""

On the day of Jewell's exoneration, Jay Leno apologized for having called him a Unadoofus.
Kent Alexander had set a firm ground rule: Only one lawyer representing Jewell could be in the room. It had been agreed that Jack Martin, the criminal specialist, would be the man, which enraged Lin Wood. ""You could really see how these guys did not like each other,"" Jewell said.

""I am not comfortable with the one-lawyer agreement,"" Wood told John Davis, Kent Alexander's second-in-command, when they were assembled. ""We have an agreement. If you attempt to renegotiate it, I will have egg on my face,"" Davis said, adding, ""You are not a man of your word."" With that, Wood recalled, he rose from his chair and started screaming, ""You are not going to say that to me, you son of a bitch!"" Kent Alexander interrupted, saying, ""This is deteriorating. We aim to stop this. Let's just regroup.""

When Jewell, Davis, and Martin finally sat down for the interview, Larry Landers, a special agent with the G.B.I., and F.B.I. special agent Bill Lewis had lists of questions with blank space for answers in front of them. On the wall of the windowless room, there were extensive aerial photographs of the park and, as a prop, an actual park bench was later brought in. Martin believed that the agents intended to resolve areas in the affidavits and other questions: Had Richard ever accessed Candyman's Candyland for information on the Anarchists' Cookbook? Had Richard picked up any pieces of pipe when the park was under construction? Had he told anyone, ""Take my picture now, because I am going to be famous""? None of this had happened, Jewell said. All he could remember telling someone was that he was off to Atlanta and ""going to be in that mess down there,"" meaning the traffic jams. They pressed him about seemingly inconsistent statements he had made on the morning of the bombing: Why had he told Agent Poor everything was normal when he checked the perimeter of the fence? Jewell explained that he had been walking the ""inside of the fence."" He once again explained that he had wanted to work the sound-and-light tower so that he could watch the entertainment; he had arranged for his mother to hear Kenny Rogers four days before the explosion.

The area, he told Landers, was ""a sweet site"" and a great place to look at girls. During a break, Martin asked about all his references to women. Jewell said he wanted them to know he wasn't gay. On several occasions, Landers became annoyed: Why couldn't Jewell pin down the times? Had he seen the drunks on the bench between 10:30 and 11 or between 11 and 11:30? Why hadn't he looked at his watch? Jewell later recalled, ""I said, 'I don't go through my life looking at my watch. I don't care about time. When the bomb went off, I did not look at my watch.' They were wanting to know what time I went to the bathroom and stuff like that. When you have the runs, you are not really concerned about what time it is. You are concerned with getting to the bathroom.""

On the day after the F.B.I. meeting, Jack Martin dictated a 27-page account of everything that had been said during the six-hour interview. In the last moments, Davis said, ""he wanted to give Richard the opportunity once and for all to say that he didn't do it."" Jewell, Martin wrote, ""unequivocally and fortunately said that he had nothing to do with the bomb and didn't know anything about the bomb and if he did he would be the first to deliver the bastard to their door."" When Martin walked out, he thought to himself, This really was a formality. They had nothing.

In November a rumor swept through the newsroom of The A.J.C. that Cox newspaper executives were rethinking their news policies. According to one reporter, ""The sloppiness of the Jewell reporting and the lack of sources was the last straw."" A reporter named Carrie Teegardin was assigned to write a piece examining how the media spotlight was turned on Richard Jewell. In large part, her article wound up being an examination of the role of The A.J.C. After Wood and Grant threatened to sue, the article was killed. ""We didn't get through the editing of it,"" John Walter said. ""The Jewells' attorney began saying, 'We're thinking lawsuit' . . . and that made us more cautious."" Meanwhile, Lin Wood and Wayne Grant were busy holding meetings with lawyers from NBC and Piedmont College. At NBC, Tom Brokaw's carelessness reportedly cost the network more than $500,000 to settle Jewell's claims, although Jewell's lawyers would not confirm a figure, BROKAW GOOFED AND NBC PAID, the New York Daily News would later headline. In talks with Ray Cleere, the figure of $450,000 by way of settlement was first suggested, then withdrawn when Piedmont College learned that it had insurance. ""This will cost them millions now,"" Lin Wood believes.

On one occasion I asked Richard Jewell if he had any theories about who might have placed the bomb. Jewell said he had popped ""two or three theories off the top of my head"" on the night he was interviewed by the F.B.I. ""I have gone over that night hundreds of times in my head. You try to think, What type of person would do that? I know it is someone who wanted to hurt people. It is someone who is sick. I hope they find him so he can get the help he needs. Because I am totally torn up about what happened. Every day I think about it, and I will think about it for the rest of my life.""

Jewell often speaks with Bryant three times a day. As Jewell searches for a new job, he hangs around Bryant's office, and he recently studied handwriting analysis at the police academy. He has been offered several security jobs with Georgia companies, but he is hoping he will be hired as a Cobb County deputy. In the meantime, Bryant, Wood, and Grant have become sought-after speakers on the First Amendment.

At F.B.I. headquarters in late October, Bobi Jewell broke down and cried as she identified their possessions—the Disney tapes, the Tupperware, Richard's AT&amp;T uniforms, address books. It was a tableau of ordinary middle-class life, laid out on brown paper on a long conference-room table. ""I just don't fucking believe this,"" Watson Bryant said angrily as he packed Bobi's videos into packing crates. ""The agents tried to shake my hand,"" Bobi told me. ""I wouldn't touch them."" It took 10 hours to remove their possessions, Bobi recalled, and four minutes to return them.

The F.B.I. is working on a new and elaborate theory of who did place the bomb in Centennial Park. There is an informed opinion that the backpack discovered a week earlier had in fact been a test run to check F.B.I. procedures, and that the bomber—perhaps a member of a militia group—was quite experienced and had struck before. After a torrent of criticism in the press, Louis Freeh announced that the F.B.I. had arrested Harold Nicholson, an alleged spy for Russia, and he used the opportunity to appear on the Today show and Good Morning America, hyping his role in what was a minor arrest, according to one former F.B.I. agent.

In Australia in November, Bill Clinton was asked about his campaign contributions from Indonesia. ""One of the things I would urge you to do, remembering what happened to Mr. Jewell in Atlanta, remembering what has happened to so many of the accusations . . . that have been made against me that turned out to be totally baseless, I just think that we ought to . . . get the facts out."" When Jewell learned of his comment, he pulled up the transcript from the Internet and became angry: ""The president is just using me, like everyone else.""

What rights does a private citizen have against the government? The legal precedent for suing the F.B.I., Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents, focuses on the behavior of individual agents. Wood believes that Jewell has a strong case against Johnson and Rosario. When Wood learned of Colonel Ressler, he hired him as a possible trial expert. In December, the F.B.I. announced that it would pay up to $500,000 to anyone who could lead it to the Olympic Park bomber.

As Jewell and I drove back from Habersham County in November, he went over the early-morning hours of July 27: ""I remember all of the people who were my responsibility. I remember the guys' faces who were flying through the air. I remember people screaming. The sirens going off. I don't think I will ever forget any of that. You just kind of wish sometimes. You think, Could I have done something else? . . . What if we only had five more minutes? Then maybe nobody would have been hurt. But you are what-if-ing. I have been over it a thousand times. I think we could not have done it any better. I think that is something I will always be wondering.""

He said he was not sure if he would ever get a job in law enforcement again, particularly since he had been held up as a cartoon figure. On the day of Jewell's exoneration, Jay Leno apologized for having called him a Unadoofus, and said, ""If Jewell wins his lawsuit with NBC, he will be my new boss."" He later said that this was ""the greatest week in trailer-park history."" The Atlanta radio station 96 Rock had put billboards of Jewell all over town; ""Freebird,"" they said, a reference to the Lynyrd Skynyrd song. Jewell would later file suit against the station, but the billboard's message was clear. Jewell knows that for many people in America there will perhaps always be a subtle doubt: What if, after all, Richard Jewell really did do it? What if the government let him go simply because it could not make its case? Then he becomes not the innocent Richard Jewell, but the Richard Jewell who may be innocent. ""You don't get back what you were originally,"" he told me. ""I don't think I will ever get that back. The first three days, I was supposedly their hero—the person who saves lives. They don't refer to me that way anymore. Now I am the Olympic Park bombing suspect. That's the guy they thought did it. ""

        之前只看过东木老爷子的《百万美元宝贝》，对他不甚了解。但单从这部和《百》来看，着实可以看出他的过人之处：不用很多的技巧修饰，利用故事本身来打动观众。在我来看，他是一个具有“内力”的导演；可能也是因为将近耄耋的高龄，他的作品因而显得精准有力。
        现实题材与写实主义的风格无疑最大程度体现了他这种“内力”；同时，同等程度地，将演员的演技无限的放大。山姆洛克威尔、乔恩哈姆等人贡献了优秀的表演；保罗沃尔特豪泽（终于不需要演类似于《黑色党徒》《我，托尼娅》里面的胖傻叉了！），本片的男主，堪称完美的人选；而最最让我感动与惊讶的是男主母亲，扮演者凯西贝茨的表演（爆奶今年奥提！）。那段发言的表演过于真实，丝毫没有修饰的痕迹。我看过很多的哭戏，几乎没有一个像这样富有层次与感染力，既内敛同时有张力。就像影片中所说的那样，她的表演完美的诠释了truth而不是fact。
        很庆幸能在家乡看了如此动人的新年第一部。可笑的是，家乡当地仅有的三家艺术影院之中，作为丽水地区电影院的“霸主”、本应该引领地区的某两影院，却如同吝啬鬼一般的不给真正的CINIMA一次上映的机会，而给某些辣鸡“视频”（恕我直言）以大量场次。而相比之下一个几乎无人问津的小资影厅，却拥有相当的职业的当担与操守。其实不只是我家乡，全国各地情况都是如此，例如同样加入艺联的著名的某达影院，也几乎没有《朱》与《别》的排片。
        我大学不修经济，仅以高中知识，我不是特别清楚这里面供求关系。但我确切地意识到，如果市场只单方面提供娱乐向的“游乐园式”的电影而忽略了这些艺术电影，也行将来的观众们会认为电影只是用来娱乐的，马丁的预言或将实现。我相信这就是艺术电影联盟为艺术电影奋斗的原因，特别是为了中国电影事业的未来。而那部分唯利是图的商人，自以为在经济上为中国电影事业尽一份力，实则可能真的荼毒了万千的观众，断送中国电影的未来。
        我看的那个场次，到场的观众寥寥无几；也许都是电影爱好者，出现片尾CAST的时候，许久，大家都没有动弹。在寥寥无几的观众里，我惊讶地发现了两个十多岁的小朋友。在幽暗的影厅里，在他们眼神中，我似乎看到了灼烈的焰火。我没有老到可以感慨岁月流逝白驹过隙、时间的不易，但我看到他们时，我可以说，我看见了电影的某种未来，一种我期待的未来。
         有时我会想，这些电影真的就那么“艺术”吗？难道真的就那么无聊、枯燥以至于大家都不想看吗？中国电影票房真的只能靠“话题“流量”来支持吗？我以我亲身体会来看：非也。仅以这部而言，观影的门槛很低，懂电影的人也许能看到更多，不大懂的人也能感受它的魅力。连小孩子都来看，为什么成年人不行呢？更何况最近佳片稀少，《朱》与《别》理应加大排片量。
        其实，更重要的，不是供应不足，而是需求不够，是很多人没有做出尝试。横向比较于类似的艺术形式，书的普及应该算是很成功的了。既然书能够做到，为什么电影不能呢？我一直认为电影的商业形式是双向性的，就像没去过海边不知道海有多宽广一样，没多看佳片的人是不知道电影的艺术有多美。我由衷希望未来有更多的人能像从小学习看书、绘画、声乐一样，学会看电影、欣赏电影；把它当做一门艺术，而不是娱乐大众的道具。

其实看完以后，我们去追究为什么理查德从英雄变罪犯时，我们追究的是关乎整个美国文化对某种标签下(大龄单身和妈妈一起住的胖子)的人的偏见、关乎美国司法体制的漏洞、更关乎大众心理学和人性……等更宽广的社会议题。

而对于现实主义题材来说，故事的起因可以是偶然的，但是推动故事前行的力量越是必然的，这个故事留给人们的思考就会越深邃。

比如在《我不是药神》中，激发药方(或警察)和癌症患者之间的矛盾，不是因为某个人物的好或坏，也不是因为谁的运气特别好或不好，而是因为——老百姓的“穷病”：穷是原罪，尽管垂危的病人们很可怜，但是我们目前也找不到为高额医药费买单的对象。药厂与病人们的矛盾是必然的，观众们也会去追寻这道社会难题当下或是未来的解决之道。

可是，这部电影里，由于理查德对立面的主要人物都“坏得很肤浅”，让作为观众的我会认为，如果他面对的是一个正直的FBI警探和客观的记者，也许就不会遭遇这样的困境。对于这种现实题材的作品，如果推动故事矛盾走向的核心力量的偶然性增加一分，那么电影的厚重感就少一分，我们对社会现状的反思就会降低一分。",1.0,,0

屡次“失职”的官员，强烈的渴望赎罪和改正的欲望，代表了内部并不严密，狡诈，专制的官僚，人们被教育要尊重权力机关，但是权力机关有时却并不尊重个人，这或许就是接受传统政治教育的男主角接受到的最大的教育。一个公民与强大的权力机构对抗，与“正义”对抗，与无良的商业媒体对抗，这是极其困难的。但是他最后挺了过去，他胜利了，毕竟，正义是无法被虚构的。诈取是有效的手段，但在本质上有失公正。 男主角或许是一个典型的“失意的美国人”，白人男性，中年，肥胖，奇特的一些癖好，和母亲住在一起等等，这个人，在正常情况下尚且拥有消极的自由，但是，当媒体，公众将目光聚焦在他的身上，他就失去了个人的隐私，价值乃至尊严，被贬低为一个拥有极端倾向，爱做白日梦却难成功的幼稚，极端，变态的社会败类，失败者，正好是最佳的嫌疑人，而英雄变为罪犯的经典桥段更是为一般民众所喜闻乐见，于是，男主角自然成为了被攻击的对象，说到底，社会所追求的积极自由仍旧发挥着不可忽视的力量，只是一般情况下不被人所接受罢了。男主角的人格被摧毁了，正如他一直以来经历的事情一样，他是一个纯朴，善良乃至有些刻板的家伙，但是也是被取笑的对象，一个人的执念和自卑所造成的冲突使得他性格出现了极端的倾向，变得格外的软弱，但是内心里充满了愤怒。值得庆幸的是，他最终克服了，这次的事件直接原因在于他过去所为的种种想要证明自己的荒唐事情（最讽刺的地方在于他过分尊重公权力，但是自己却在贯彻正义的过程中屡次违法，说到底他的尊重只不过是对自卑的补偿，警察对警察，他自己也被提升了），他超越了过去的自己，终于正视自己的软弱，承认自己的不足，从失意中吸取教训，终于踏踏实实地成为了警察，最后的人生的最后岁月实现了自己的梦想，人们口中的“死肥宅”也能成为英雄，这本身就是一个伟大的证明。 电影中没有展示的，现实中NBC赔偿了朱维尔一家巨额的补偿费，以及无良的记者因为不透露信息来源被起诉。女记者留下了眼泪，标志着媒体良知和职业道德的一种回归和反思，但是政府却没有回应，乃至探员最后还认定朱维尔有罪，难道说，除了社会舆论（以及背后的大众），媒体外，联邦政府司法机关就没有过失吗，是有的，看似再完备的司法体制，也有其执行的问题，因为人，总会犯错，如律师所言，“不要因为有一些权力就变成混蛋”，更何况世上哪里有完美的体制呢？正义是极其难以达到的，实质正义极难，程序正义亦不易，人类始终要面对自己的弱点，不断地自勉，不断地互相提醒，用各种制度限制人的欲望和罪恶，人们归根到底并不是完全理性的存在，当公众演化为乌合之众时更是如此，人们会用道德去主观评判别人，去想象戏剧化的情节，沉浸在虚假的愉悦中，会歧视各种少数群体，会因为情绪化做出看似正义实则愚蠢的举动。当朱维尔的母亲声泪俱下地哭诉时，汹涌的舆情平息了。人们感慨于这巨大的迫害与先入为主的预设完成的伤害，因为道德而愤怒的人们终于最后因为道德而平静了，甚至媒体也开始了反思，如果没有亲身经历，或者缺乏想象，人们就不会产生真切的同情，作为感情的生物，我们就是如此。 “总统先生，请帮帮我们，用你的权力可以结束这一切。”除了英雄被玷污外，这难道不是最讽刺之处吗？",3.0,,0
