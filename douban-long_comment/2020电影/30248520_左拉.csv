It’s kind of long but so full of suspense“   摘自：http://moviemarker.co.uk    摘自：http://moviemarker.co.uk  The film is designed and structured like social media. Filmmaker Bravo fittingly makes you feel like you’re scrolling and reading through the film. It lays everything bare – the dusk laden with bewitching color and the extrinsic coolness has something endearingly personal about it. But at the same time, it also seems convenient and at home with its exciting atmosphere, technicality, and plot. So much so that the director seems to lack the sharpness it could have had. At times, the writing doesn’t have enough clarity about its liberties (if any) and something truly feels blank or rather astray about the progressions.   摘自：www.austinchronicle.com",1.0,,0

Zola (Paige) is an African-American waitress and part-time stripper living in Detroit who finds a fast friend in Stefani (Keough), also a stripper. Invited by Stefani, along with her boyfriend Derrek (Braun) and roommate X (Domingo), for a weekend trip to Tampa, Florida, ostensibly to earn some cash in a strip club, Zola is plunged into an unsavory 3-day escapade that ends with blood-spurting and a suicide attempt. Purportedly based on the real story, ZOLA smugly shoves its stranger-than-fiction novelty down our throats, you don’t need a keen sense to suss some whoring carryings-on are afoot, and the two girls’ solidarity is paper thin, who can trust a friend you are merely acquaint with for a day? Zola’s own moral compass is also shonky. That said, squatting in the moral high ground, Zola (the movie is her story to tell, Stefani’s perspective is apportioned to a short stint, but her say-so is so flimsy that whatever comes from her mouth barely holds water) becomes the reluctant minder of Stefani’s escort business, but not for once, she debases herself in the sack, on top of that, she is so canny that it makes Stefani and X, yes, he is her pimp, look like greenhorns, the two cannot even fathom a fair market price for their service. That sounds suspiciously self-boasting in Zola’s part. I’m not saying that what Zola tells is not the truth, only by my lights, I think everyone should take an autobiographical source material with a pinch of salt, when the author remains squeaky clean amid the grubby mess, it often impairs the story’s credence. Also, the script fails to energize Zola’s own actions, most of the time, she just goes through the motions with a miffed passivity, silently passes judgment to what happens, she has ample chances to skip town but she poutingly stays, both fascinated and disgusted by the rabbit hole she descends into. Plainly put, you just cannot warm up to Zola, Paige gives a fine performance, but Zola is a cipher, she hogs the spotlight but has no flex to flourish . Keough is at risk of being typecast as a white-trash girl of fickle and untrustworthy dispositions, no sparkles fly between her Stefani and Paige’s Zola, girl power has nothing to do with their guarded interactions. Conversely, the male actors comport themselves much better, Jason Mitchell has his moment as a slimy trickster; Braun’s gangly desperation of a schlemiel has a modicum of innocence in the center that it even feels touching, and Domingo is scary, despicable but also eloquent in incarnating X’s mutable facets, he is the real deal among the fold, yet, we are saddled most of time with two lesser creatures, in this prismatic, grainy, symmetry-abiding, faux-candid exploit that never fully rises to the occasion to be a legit sensation, and inter alia, Mica Levi's distinguishable score deserves a better story to shore up. referential entries: Andrea Arnold’s AMERICAN HONEY (2016, 7.9/10); Safdie Brothers’ GOOD TIME (2017, 7.1/10); Lorene Scafaria’s HUSTLERS (2019, 6.6/10).
